            <h3>Key Terms</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Geography</b>: The study of Earth’s physical and human systems and the relationships among them.</li>
            <li><b>Population Density</b>: Figure calculated by dividing the population of a region by the region’s area.</li>
            <li><b>Map</b>: Representation of Earth’s features drawn on a flat surface.</li>
            <li><b>Scale</b>: Measurement on a map that represents an actual distance on Earth’s surface.</li>
            <li><b>Latitude</b>: Distance north or south of the equator, measured in degrees.</li>
            <li><b>Longitude</b>: Distance east and west of the prime meridian, measured in degrees.</li>
            <li><b>Continental Drift</b>: Theory by German scientist Alfred Wegener stating that 300 million years ago all of Earth’s land masses, which were in constant motion, collided to form one supercontinent Pangaea. About 200 million years ago Pangaea broke apart and the continents have drifted apart to their present locations. According to his theory, only continents drifted.</li>
            <li><b>Pangaea</b>: Supercontinent that included all Earth’s land masses. It existed from <div style="color:red; display:inline">300 million years ago</div> and began breaking up <div style="color:red; display:inline">200 million years ago</div>.</li>
            <li><b>Plate Tectonics</b>: The theory states that Earth’s outer shell is made up of about 20 plates. It is likely that <b>convection currents</b> caused by the unequal distribution of heat within the Earth’s core cause the plates to move.</li>
            <li><b>Convection Currents</b>: Circular movement in a gas or liquid created by uneven heating.</li>
            <li><b>Erosion</b>: Wearing away of Earth’s surface followed by the movement to other locations of materials that have worn away.</li>
            <li><b>Geologic Time</b>: History of Earth from its formation to the present. Earth’s history may be divided into several major time periods, called eras:
            <ul>
            	<li>Cenozoic era (<div style="color:red; display:inline">66 million years ago to present</div>)</li>
				<li>Mesozoic era (<div style="color:red; display:inline">245 million to 66 million years ago</div>)</li>
				<li>Paleozoic era (<div style="color:red; display:inline">570 million to 245 million years ago</div>)</li>
				<li>Precambrian era (<div style="color:red; display:inline">4.6 billion to 570 million years ago</div>)</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
            <li><b>Soil</b>: Surface layer of Earth, composed of mineral and organic materials, air, and water.</li>
            <li><b>Humus</b>: Dark, upper layer of soil made up of partially decayed plant material.</li>
            <li><b>Soil Profile</b>: Different horizons (layers) in the soil and the rock layer (bedrock) below the soil. Each horizon has different physical, biological, and chemical characteristics.</li>
            <li><b>Leaching</b>: removal of minerals from soil by water as it moves downward through the soil. Leaching occurs in wet climates. Leached soils can be much more productive in farming if natural or chemical fertilizers are used to replace leached nutrients.</li>
            <li><b>Calcification</b>: : Process by which, in dry climates, water carrying dissolved minerals moves upward through the soil. At the surface, the water evaporates, leaving the minerals behind. The result is the creation of a thick topsoil layer that is rich in minerals. In very dry climates, however, the amount of mineral deposition can be so great that it forms a layer poisonous to plants.</li>
            <li><b>Capillary Action</b>: Movement of water upward through small spaces, as in soil.</li>
            <li><b>Ecozone</b>: A distinct ecological region determined on the basis of physical, biological, and human factors.</li>
            <li><b>Immigrate</b>: To move permanently to a country other than one’s native country.</li>
            <li><b>Emigrate</b>: To leave your country of origin to live permanently in another country.</li>
            <li><b>Demography</b>: Study of population numbers, distribution, trends, and issues.</li>
            <li><b>Dependancy Load</b>: Proportion of the population that is not in the workforce; total number of people under 14 and over 65.</li>
            <li><b>Aboriginal Peoples</b>: Descendants of Canada’s first inhabitants.</li>
            <li><b>Treaty</b>: Figure calculated by dividing the population of a region by the region’s area.</li>
            <li><b>Economic Base</b>: Economic activities that allow a community to exist. For example, a town might exist because a mineral resource in the area is being developed.</li>
            <li><b>First Nations</b>: An Aboriginal group whose members wish to be treated as a distinct group on the basis of a shared common culture and history.</li>
            <li><b>Assimilate</b>: To lose your culture and adopt the culture of the larger group within which you live.</li>
            <li><b>Specific Claim</b>: First Nation’s claim based on a belief that the government did not fulfill its obligations under a treaty or other agreement related to land, money, or other assets.</li>
            <li><b>Comprehensive Claim</b>: Claim available to First Nations who have never signed treaties in the past that deals with many issues, including land ownership, self-government, ownership and control of resources, hunting/fishing/trapping rights, and financial compensation.</li>
            <li><b>Settlement Pattern</b>: Distribution of homes, farms, villages, towns, and cities in an area.</li>
            <li><b>Population Distribution</b>: Pattern showing where people live in an area. For example, a scattered distribution along a coastline or road.</li>
            <li><b>Basic Industry</b>: Industry that sells its products outside the community, bringing money into the community.</li>
            <li><b>Non-Basic Industry</b>: Industry that sells its products within the community. It does not bring money into the community.</li>
            <li><b>Land Use</b>: How urban, suburban, or rural land is and can be used (eg. parks, housing, industry, commercial, agriculture, etc.).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chapter 1: An Overview</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Canada's Population: 36,250,000 (2016)</li>
            <li>World's Population: 7,400,000,000 (2016)</li>
            <li>Canada's Population Density: 3/km<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li>GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita is the value of all goods and services produced in the country in a year. GDP divided by the country’s population, the result is an indication of the average wealth per person.
            <ul>
            <li>Canada's GDP per capita: $38293.28 USD (2014)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Canada: high immigration rate, high life expectancy, great amount of freshwater, low number of prisoners, highly educated, environmentally sustainnable method, high <b>HDI (Human Development Index)</b> → combines measures in three critical areas: health, education, and wealth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chapter 2: Maps: The Geographer’s Basic Tools</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>A <b>map</b> is a representation of Earth’s features drawn on a flat surface.</li>
            <li>Six basic map features:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Title</b></li>
            <li><b>Legend</b></li>

            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The <b>scale</b> of a map shows the relationship between the size of an object in real life and its size as drawn on the map.
            <ol>
            <li>Fraction or ratio (eg. 1:50,000) </li>
            <li>Direct statement scale (eg. 1cm to 0.5km)</li>
            <li>Line scale (graphic)</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Small-Scale Maps</b> show a small amount of detail in a large area. They are used to show more general information such as physical, political, or economic information. (1 : 200 000 or less)</li>
            <li><b>Large-Scale Maps</b> show a large amount of detail in a small area. They are used for more detailed tasks, such as residential planning, military operations, and for hiking trails. (1 : 100 000 or more)</li>
            <li>Three main types of maps:
            <ul>
            <li><b>General-Purpose Maps</b> contain many different types of information, relatively accurate (eg. atlas maps, wall maps, road maps, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>General-Purpose Maps</b> contain many different types of information, relatively accurate (eg. atlas maps, wall maps, road maps, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Topographic Maps</b> use symbols to show a variety of features. Two important features are <b>contour lines</b> and <b>grid systems</b>. Useful for examining detailed characteristics of a small area.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Map projections:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Equal Area</b>: Correct relative size of countries avoiding major distortion.</li>
            <li><b>Mercator</b>: True compass bearings, but distorts distance and size of land.</li>
            <li><b>Winkel Tripel</b>: Balanced between size and shape.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Geotechnology: <b>GPS (Global Positioning System)</b></li>
            <li><b>Waypoint</b>: A stored location in a GPS unit.</li>
            <li><b>Telematic Device</b>: Combines GPS capabilities with the ability to transmit vehicle locations to a remote receiver.</li>
