            <li><b>Map</b>: Representation of Earth’s features drawn on a flat surface.</li>
            <li><b>Scale</b>: Measurement on a map that represents an actual distance on Earth’s surface.</li>
            <div class="key" id="long-lat">
            <li><b>Latitude</b>: Distance north or south of the equator, measured in degrees.</li>
            <li><b>Longitude</b>: Distance east and west of the prime meridian, measured in degrees.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="key" id="cont-plate">
            <li><b>Continental Drift</b>: Theory by German scientist Alfred Wegener stating that 300 million years ago all of Earth’s land masses, which were in constant motion, collided to form one supercontinent Pangaea. About 200 million years ago Pangaea broke apart and the continents have drifted apart to their present locations. According to his theory, only continents drifted.</li>
            <li><b>Plate Tectonics</b>: The theory states that Earth’s outer shell is made up of about 20 plates. It is likely that <b>convection currents</b> caused by the unequal distribution of heat within the Earth’s core cause the plates to move.</li>
            </div>
            <li><b>Pangaea</b>: Supercontinent that included all Earth’s land masses. It existed from <span class="red">300 million years ago</span> and began breaking up <span class="red">200 million years ago</span>.</li>
            <li><b>Convection Currents</b>: Circular movement in a gas or liquid created by uneven heating.</li>
            <li><b>Erosion</b>: Wearing away of Earth’s surface followed by the movement to other locations of materials that have worn away.</li>
            <li><b>Geologic Time</b>: History of Earth from its formation to the present. Earth’s history may be divided into several major time periods, called eras:
            <ul>
            	<li>Cenozoic era (<span class="red">66 million years ago to present</span>)</li>
				<li>Mesozoic era (<span class="red">245 million to 66 million years ago</span>)</li>

            <div class="key" id="leach-calc">
            <li><b>Leaching</b>: Removal of minerals from soil by water as it moves downward through the soil. Leaching occurs in wet climates. Leached soils can be much more productive in farming if natural or chemical fertilizers are used to replace leached nutrients.</li>
            <li><b>Calcification</b>: Process by which, in dry climates, water carrying dissolved minerals moves upward through the soil. At the surface, the water evaporates, leaving the minerals behind. The result is the creation of a thick topsoil layer that is rich in minerals. In very dry climates, however, the amount of mineral deposition can be so great that it forms a layer poisonous to plants.</li>
            </div>
            <li><b>Capillary Action</b>: Movement of water upward through small spaces, as in soil.</li>
            <li><b>Ecozone</b>: A distinct ecological region determined on the basis of physical, biological, and human factors.</li>
            <div class="key" id="im-em-demo">
            <li><b>Immigrate</b>: To move permanently to a country other than one’s native country.</li>
            <li><b>Emigrate</b>: To leave your country of origin to live permanently in another country.</li>

            <ul>
            <li>Canada's Population: 36,250,000 (2016)</li>
            <li>World's Population: 7,400,000,000 (2016)</li>
            <li>Canada's Population Density: 3/km<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li>GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita is the value of all goods and services produced in the country in a year. GDP divided by the country’s population, the result is an indication of the average wealth per person.
            <ul>
            <li>Canada's GDP per capita: $38293.28 USD (2014)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Canada: high immigration rate, high life expectancy, great amount of freshwater, low number of prisoners, highly educated, environmentally sustainnable method, high <b>HDI (Human Development Index)</b> → combines measures in three critical areas: health, education, and wealth.</li>

            <h3>Chapter 2: Maps: The Geographer’s Basic Tools</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>A <b>map</b> is a representation of Earth’s features drawn on a flat surface.</li>
            <li>Six basic map features:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Title</b></li>
            <li><b>Legend</b></li>

            <li><b>Border</b></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The <b>scale</b> of a map shows the relationship between the size of an object in real life and its size as drawn on the map.
            <ol>
            <li>Fraction or ratio (eg. 1:50,000) </li>
            <li>Direct statement scale (eg. 1cm to 0.5km)</li>
            <li>Line scale (graphic)</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Small-Scale Maps</b> show a small amount of detail in a large area. They are used to show more general information such as physical, political, or economic information. (1 : 200 000 or less)</li>
            <li><b>Large-Scale Maps</b> show a large amount of detail in a small area. They are used for more detailed tasks, such as residential planning, military operations, and for hiking trails. (1 : 100 000 or more)</li>
            <li>Three main types of maps:
            <ul>
            <li><b>General-Purpose Maps</b> contain many different types of information, relatively accurate (atlas maps, wall maps, road maps, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Thematic Maps</b> are designed to show information on one particular topic or theme, tend to be easy to understand (TTC maps, mineral distribution map, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Topographic Maps</b> use symbols to show a variety of features. Two important features are <b>contour lines</b> and <b>grid systems</b>. Useful for examining detailed characteristics of a small area.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Map projections:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Equal Area</b>: Correct relative size of countries avoiding major distortion.</li>

            <li><b>Winkel Tripel</b>: Balanced between size and shape.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Geotechnology: <b>GPS (Global Positioning System)</b></li>
            <li><b>Waypoint</b>: A stored location in a GPS unit.</li>
            <li><b>Telematic Device</b>: Combines GPS capabilities with the ability to transmit vehicle locations to a remote receiver.</li>

            <h3>Chapter 3: Locating Places on a Map</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Longitude</b> and <b>Latitude</b> (<a href="#long-lat">See in key terms</a>)</li>
            <li><b>Compass Points</b> are such as north, southeast. The <b>cardinal points</b> of a compass are north, south, east, and west. The <b>ordinal points</b> are northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.</li>
            <li><b>Compass Bearings</b> are measured in degrees and are more accurate.</li>
            <li>Grid Rerence Systems:

            </li>
            <li><b>Making Mountains</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Collisions of Earth’s plates form mountains.</li>
            <li>They ride atop a subsurface area of molten rock whose extremes of temperatures and pressure cause convection currents.</li>
            <li>The currents move the mantle which moves the plates.</li>
            <li>When an oceanic plate meets a continental plate, the oceanic plate slides under the continental plate and causes the plate to buckle, forming mountains. Regions around the Pacific Ocean were created through this process.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Folding and Faulting</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>When pressure is being exerted towards each other, folding occurs, creating mountains.</li>
            <li>When pressure is being exerted away from each other, faulting occurs. Escarpments are caused by single faulting, rift valleys are formed by double faulting.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Land is built up through:

            <li>Earliest Era (<span class="red">4.6 billion to 570 million years ago</span>)</li>
            <li>Many cycles of building and wearing down (erosion).</li>
            <li>Single/multi-celled organisms started to appear.</li>
            <li>The foundation of Canada (Canadian Shield) was formed during this era.</li>

            <li>Refers to "ancient life" (<span class="red">570 to 245 million years ago</span>)</li>
            <li>More mountain building, lots of erosion.</li>
            <li>Erosion produced sediments which are small particles of rock which have been worn down.</li>
            <li>Layers of sediments were compressed together to form sedimentary rocks, becoming the bedrock in every province.</li>
            <li>Appalachians in Eastern Canada are formed.</li>
            <li>Age of amphibians and fish.</li>

            <li>Glaciers were the most significant force in shaping the land during this era and especially Canada.
            <ul>
            <li>They eroded and rounded the Canadian Shield and the Appalachians.</li>
            <li>Once melted, they deposited the eroded material to create the lowlands surrounding the Canadian Shield.</li>

            <li><b>Glacier</b>: Slow moving mass of ice.</li>
            <li><b>Ice Sheet</b>: Large, thick mass of ice.</li>
            <li>Ice sheets have covered vast areas of many continents in the past, including much of North America.</li>
            <li><b>Ice Age</b> (<span class="red">6000 to 10000 years ago</span>)
            <ul>
            <li>Period of time when freezing temperatures created ice sheets across continents.</li>
            <li>Temperatures were low enough to allow ice to accumulate in great amounts. Glaciers advanced (grew in size).</li>
            <li>When temperatures were warmer, glaciers retreated (shrank in size).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The <b>movement of glaciers</b> depend on climate and location</li>
            <li>2 kinds of glaciers:

            <li>Carve the land, creating U-shaped valleys.</li>
            <li>Exist in Western Cordillera and Arctic Islands (eg. Columbia Icefields: largest area of ice in Canada).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Continental Glaciers</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Move under their own weight.</li>
            <li>Weight of snow and ice itself cause ice to spread outward from <b>zone of accumulation</b> (usually located in the centre of the sheet).</li>
            <li>Areas where there is a net loss of ice is known as the <b>zone of ablation</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Glaciers move faster at the surface due to less friction.</li>
            <li><b>Transformation of Land</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>When glaciers move, they transform the land by eroding, shifting, carving, moving debris, etc.</li>
            <li>Erode high points on the land (erosional transformation).</li>
            <li>Fill in lower areas with deposits (depositional transformation).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Erosional Features</b>:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Striations</b>: Grooves gouged out in the bedrock under the ice sheet by rocks frozen in ice.</li>
            <li><b>Spillway</b>: Deep valley created by large amounts of water flowing from a melting continental glacier, if there is less water it is a misfit stream (small stream).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Depositional Features</b>:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Till</b>: Eroded material deposited directly by the ice of the glacier (mix of all material of all sizes).</li>
            <li><b>Till Plain</b>: Flat to gently hilly area created by deposition under a glacier.</li>
            <li><b>Lake Plain</b>: Fertile bottom of an ancient glacial lake now used for agriculture.</li>
            <li><b>Moraine</b>: Material deposited by a glacier that moves parallel with the glacier.</li>
            <li><b>Drumlin</b>: Egg-shaped hill with a steep side at the wide end and a gentle slope at the other. The glacier moved from the steeper to gentler slope.</li>
            <li><b>Erratics</b>: Rock picked up by ice, carried along and deposited many kilometres away. They are easily identifiable: composition is different from the bedrock of region in which it’s deposited.</li>
            <li><b>Esker</b>: Long ridge of material deposited by a meltwater stream flowing beneath the glacier.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Benefits of Glaciers</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Mined as a resource of ice (denser than ice cubes).</li>
            <li>With pollution and industry and acid rain, they are no longer mined.</li>

            <ul>
            <li><b>Climate vs Weather</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Climate: Long term patterns or trends which prevail in a region.</li>
            <li>Weather: Day to day state of the atmosphere (temperature, moisture, precipitation, wind, pressure, etc) in an area.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Climate conditions vary in Canada because:</b>
            <ol>
            <li>Canada is a very large country, it expands far from North to South, East to West.</li>
            <li>The varying elevations cause different climate conditions.</li>
            <li>Canada has both coastal and inland regions</li>
            <li>Wind and pressure systems move weather conditions from one area to another.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Factors That Affect Climate</b>:
            <ol>
            <li><b>L</b>atitude</li>
            <li><b>O</b>cean Currents</li>
            <li><b>W</b>inds and Air Masses</li>
            <li><b>E</b>levation</li>
            <li><b>R</b>eleif (and Other Precipitation)</li>
            <li><b>Near Water</b></li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Latitude</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Canada's land extends from <b>41&deg;N</b> to <b>83&deg;N</b>.</li>
            <li>At higher latitudes, the sun's energy is more spread out: cooler temperatures</li>
            <li>Closer to the equator, the sun's energy is more concentrated: warmer temperatures</li>
            <li>Distance from the equator is a key factor in whether a region is hot or cold.</li>
            <li>As the latitude goes up, temperature goes down.</li>
            <li>Earth’s curvature causes the sun’s energy to be less concentrated at the poles than near the equator.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Ocean Currents</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Temperature of an ocean current affects the temperature of the air that passes over it.</li>
            <li>The air then tranfers these characteristics onto land</li>
            <li><b>5 Ocean Currents That Affect Canada</b>:
            <ul>
            <li><span class="red">North Pacific Current</span></li>
            <li><span class="red">Gulf Stream</span></li>
            <li><span class="blue">California Current</span></li>
            <li><span class="red">North Atlantic Drift</span></li>
            <li><span class="blue">Labrador Current</span></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The air above where warm and cool currents meet (eg. Air above the area where the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream meet) is often moist/damp and foggy. The warmer moist air rises, expands, cools on the cooler air, condenses, and precipitates, causing fog.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Winds and Air Masses</b>:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Air Mass</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Large volume of air.</li>
            <li>Takes on the climate conditions (temperature and precipitation) where it is formed.</li>
            <li>Transfers those conditions to places where it travels.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Wind</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Wind is created when air masses move.</li>
            <li>Air moves when there is a difference in air pressure.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Air Pressure
            <ul>
            <li><b>Low Pressure</b>:Areas where earth is hot and air above it is warmed, air <b>rises</b> and air pressure will be <b>low</b>.</li>
            <li><b>High Pressure</b>: In the atmosphere, air cools and starts to <b>fall</b>. Air pressure in this area is <b>high.</b></li>
            <li>Air moves from high to low pressure, causing wind.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Precipitation Characteristics</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Originating over water: Maritime(<b>m</b>) air mass with lots of moisture.</li>
            <li>Originating over land: Continental(<b>c</b>) dry air mass.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Temperature Characteristics</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Formed near the tropics: Tropical(<b>T</b>) hot air.</li>
            <li>Formed between 55&deg;N and 66&deg;N: Polar(<b>P</b>) cool air.</li>
            <li>Formed over the Arctic: Arctic(<b>A</b>) very cold air.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Air mass over southern continental United States: cT = Continental Tropical = hot dry air.</li>
            <li>Air mass over the Gulf of Mexico: mT = Maritime Tropical = warm moist air.</li>
            <li>Differential heating of the Earth has created high and low pressure wind belts.</li>
            <li>3 main kinds of prevailing winds:
            <ul>
            <li>Polar Easterlies</li>
            <li>Westerlies</li>
            <li>Northeast Trades</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Westerlies</b> move across Canada</li>
            <li>The <b>Polar Front</b> is the boundary between cold, dry polar air and warm, wet tropical air. High above the front is the polar front jet stream (a current of fast moving air). The front is responsible for most of Canada's precipitation</li>
            <li>The winds and jet stream shift according to the seasons.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Elevation</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Atmospheric pressure decreases with higher altitude/elevation. Air at higher altitudes expand due to the lower air pressure.</li>
            <li>When it expands, it cools. Eventually it reaches its dewpoint (the maximum amount of moisture the air mass can hold). Further cooling leads to condensation (water vapour to liquid water).</li>
            <li>Air cools slower above condensation point because the act of condensation produces heat.
            <ul>
            <li><b>Below</b> the condensation point, the rate of change is <b>&minus;1&deg;C/100m</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Above</b> the condensation point, the rate of change is <b>&minus;0.6&deg;C/100m</b>.</li>
            <li>The temperature drops steadily with increase in elevation.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Relief and Other Precipitation</b>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Releif Precipitation</b>
            <ul>
            <li>When moisture encounters barriers of high releif (eg. mountains), it rises.</li>
            <li><b>Windward Slope</b>:
            <ol>
            <li>As moist air rises, it expands, cools and condenses.</li>
            <li>As water droplets grow, they form raindrops.</li>
            <li>When they become too heavy to stay suspended in air, they fall out of the sky as a form of precipitation.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Leeward Slope</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Cold air descends the leeward slope, contracts, and becomes warmer.</li>
            <li>There is a decrease in condensation and clouds.</li>
            <li>The leeward slope (rain shadow) has a drier climate than windward slope of barrier.</li>
            <li>In Canada, Westerlies move warm moist air from the ocean to the coast mountains and the Western Cordillera.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cyclonic Precipitation</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Also known as <b>frontal precipitation</b>, brings out extended periods of inclement weather.</li>
            <li>In areas where warm and cold air masses collide, cyclonic precipitation could occur.</li>
            <li>Lighter, warmer moist air is forced to rise above the colder, denser air.</li>
            <li>It occurs along the polar front.</li>
            <li>Counter clockwise cyclonic activity, moves from Western Canada to Eastern Canada.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Convectional Precipitation</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>In many areas of Canada, this type of precipitation brings more summer rain than winter precipitation.</li>
            <li>Violent, short-lived rain storms that usually occur in the afternoon or evenings of hot days.
            <ul>
            <li>Summer heat warms ground</li>
            <li>Air warms, rises, expands, cools, condenses, precipitates</li>
            <li>Updrafts and downdrafts create hail and strong winds</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <h3>Chapter 14: Canada’s Soil and Natural Vegetation Connections</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Soil</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Consists of four main parts: <b>minerals</b>, <b>bacteria and organic materials</b>, <b>air</b>, and <b>moisture</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Topsoil</b>: Rich in organic materials, especially near the surface. Dark brown or black in colour.</li>
            <li><b>Subsoil</b>: Combined mineral and organic layer. Lighter brown in colour.</li>
            <li><b>Parent Material</b>: Mineral materials from which soil is made. Usually bedrock or glacial deposits.</li>
            <li><b>Loam</b>: A well-balanced mixture of sand, silt, clay, and humus.</li>
            <li><b>Leaching</b> and <b>Calcification</b> (<a href="#leach-calc">See in key terms</a>):</li>
            <li>Because of the Western Cordillera’s varied relief and climate patterns, a complex pattern of soils exists, and the characteristics of the soil can change completely over very short distances.</li>
            <li>In contrast, the harsh climate of the tundra soils region makes soil formation difficult. The short, cool growing season limits plant growth and slows the breakdown of organic materials into humus. Because of the permafrost, the soil drains poorly and is often waterlogged. As a result, air may be missing from the soil’s profile.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Natural Vegetation Regions</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Natural vegetation refers to those plants that grow without any human interference.</li>
            <li><b>Tundra</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Most northerly vegetation region of Canada.</li>
            <li>Located above the tree line, which marks the northern boundary of most tree growth.</li>
            <li>Most of the tundra has permafrost, or ground that has been frozen for over two years.</li>
            <li>Only permits the growth of small shrubs, mosses, grasses and lichens.</li>
            <li>The lack of vegetation limits the variety of wildlife as well as the population of each species.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Boreal and Taiga Forest</b>
            <ul>
            <li>The largest vegetation region in Canada.</li>
            <li>Coniferous trees&mdash;such as spruce, pines, hemlock, and cedar&mdash;grow in this vegetation region. They have characteristics that make them well-suited to cold temperatures and short growing seasons.</li>
            <li>The lack of humus, combined with the high level of acidity and the leaching effect of water, makes these wet-climate soils infertile and unsuitable for agriculture.</li>
            <li>The northern part of the region is the taiga forest and the southern part is the boreal forest. The taiga forest is less dense than the boreal forest, and has smaller trees that take much longer to grow.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Mixed Forest</b>
            <ul>
            <li>The mixed forest is a transition zone between the boreal and taiga forest to the north and the deciduous forest to the south. Consists of deciduous and coniferous trees&mdash;such as maple, beech, ash, oak, and birch along with spruce, fir, pine, cedar, and hemlock.</li>
            <li>Excellent resource for the lumbering industry.</li>
            <li>Southern region has been cleared because of farming, lumbering, urban development, and transportation routes.</li>
            <li>Soils in the mixed forest regions are well-suited to farming.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Deciduous Forest</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Very small region. Most of this region has been cleared for farming and urban development.</li>
            <li>Conditions are ideal for hardwood trees such as maple, beech, hickory, ash, and black walnut.</li>
            <li>Soils are similar to those of the mixed forest. Most fertile soils of eastern Canada.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Grasslands</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Located in the southern part of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.</li>
            <li>Climate is too dry for most species of trees to survive.</li>
            <li>Drought-resistant short grasses, sagebrush, and cactus grow in the short-grass prairie, in southern Saskatchewan and Alberta.</li>
            <li>The long-grass prairie contains the richest soil in Canada and some of the most productive grain-growing land in the world.</li>
            <li>Parkland is a transition zone of long-grass prairie dotted with clumps of trees.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cordilleran Vegetation</b>
            <ul>
            <li>The variation of vegetation is a result of the wide range of temperatures, rainfall, soils, and elevations throughout the region.</li>
            <li>Account for the large variety of natural vegetation.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>West Coast Forest</b>
            <ul>
            <li>The heavy rainfall plus the mild climate of the coastal region provide excellent growing conditions for the trees of this temperate rain forest.</li>
            <li>Lush forests of Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, red cedar, and western hemlock grow in this region.</li>
            <li>Trees more than a metre in diameter and over 50 metres high are common.</li>

            <li><b>Child Mortality Rate</b>: Yearly number of deaths under eight years old per 1000.</li>
            <li><b>Refugee</b>: A person who immigrates to another country out of fear of persecution in his or her own country.</li>
            <li><b>Immigration Rate</b>: Number of new Canadians who have immigrated here from another country per 1000 of Canada's population.</li>
            <li><b>Emigration Rate</b>: Yearly number of people who move elsewhere.</li>
            <li><b>Net Migration Rate</b>: The difference between people moving to a country and people moving elsewhere from that same country.</li>
            <li><b>Push Factor</b>: Something that makes people want to leave their country and move to another (famine, war, disease, discrimination, unemployment, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Pull Factor</b>: Something that attracts people to another country (education opportunities, employment opportunities, freedom of speech, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Population Growth Rate</b>: Measurement that combines both natural increase and net migration to calculate the overall growth of a country’s population.</li>
            <li><b>Life Expectancy</b>: The average lifespan of a person.</li>
            <li><b>Baby Boom</b>: The large rise in the birth rate experienced by many countries in Europe and North America between 1946 and 1961.</li>
            <li><b>Doubling Time</b>: How long it would take for a country’s population to double at that country’s current rate of population growth.</li>
            <li><b>Rule of 70</b>: The calculation that determines the number of years it will take for a country’s population to double. You take 70 and divide it by the <b>population growth rate</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Population Pyramid</b>: Graph that depicts population distribution by age and sex.</li>

            <li>Children (Under 15)</li>
            <li>Working Adults (15&ndash;64)</li>
            <li>Older Adults (65+)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Dependancy Load</b>: Population that does not work and must be supported (children + older adults)&mdash;Canada has a dependency load of 37% (24% children and 13% older adults), Niger has a 49% dependency load (47% children, and 2% older adults).
            <ul>
            <li>During the 1950s, Canada’s population grew because many immigrants came into the country and people had big families (baby boom) after World War II.</li>
            <li>In 1956, there were many kids ages 0&ndash;14, who are now aged 40&ndash;59 (increasing amount of older people).</li>
            <li>In 1956 the focus was on building schools for the large amount of children, whereas now, these children are all grown up and the focus is on health care facilities and retirement centres.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Stages of Population Change</b>
            <ol>
            <li>Combination of high birth rate and high death rate keeps the size of the population stable (no country in the world is at this stage now). Canada went through it in the 17th and 18th centuries.</li>
            <li>Death rate drops because of better healthcare and nutrition, and birth rate remains high which results in a long period of natural increase in the population. Canada’s long period of natural increase began more than 150 years ago and continued to the 1960s. This stage began to take place in developing countries only in the last 50 years.</li>
            <li>A drop in the birth rate occurs because parents limit the size of their families since they are certain their children will all survive to adulthood, and most families live in cities and not farms, so they do not need many children to do chores. This stage has only just begun in developing countries.</li>
            <li>The birth rate declines to a point where it is close to the death rate which causes the population to level off. Canada is approaching this point but has not reached it while a few countries in Eastern Europe have reached this point.</li>

            <li>Treaties are usually written in English, and Aboriginals were not familiar with the language.</li>
            <li>Aboriginals signed treaties because they wanted to maintain an economic base (retain access to enough land to support themselves by fishing and hunting) and they wanted the right to control their own affairs.</li>

            <li>Political (War, Change of Government)</li>
            <li>Economic</li>
            <li>Push/Pull Factors</li>
            <li>Intervening Obstacles</li>
            <li>Natural Factors (Internal/External)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Multiculturalism</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Canada's population is 97% immigrants or descendants of immigrants.</li>
            <li>Immigrants encouraged to retain traditions and language while integrating into Canadian culture.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Where in Canada do Immigrants Settle?</b>
            <ul>
            <li>An uneven distribution of immigrants exists in Canada.</li>
            <li>In 2001, 95% of immigrants lived in Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Alberta.</li>
            <li>Ontario (26.8%) and Alberta (26.1%) have a higher percentage of foreign born residents than the country's overall average (16.4%).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Why Don't Many People Live in Nunavut?</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Too Cold</li>
            <li>Remote</li>
            <li>Hard to Build Economic Base</li>
            <li>Infertile Land</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Three Types of Immigrants to Canada</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Canada government can admit those who qualify for immigration into Canada, but look for those willing and able to contribute to Canada's economy and society.</li>
            <li><b>Three Types</b>:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Economic Immigrants + Family</b>: Skilled workers or business immigrants to create jobs or invest.</li>
            <li><b>Family Immigrants</b>: Reunites families/close relatives&mdash;must have a relative to sponsor and support if needed.</li>
            <li><b>Refugees</b>: Fearing persecution/cruel or inhumane treatment or death due to race, religion, nationality, member of societal group, political opinion, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Interprovincial Migration</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Movement of population between provinces.</li>
            <li>In-Migration: Regions that gain migrants from other provinces.</li>
            <li>Out-Migration: Regions that lose migrants to other provinces.</li>
            <li>The governmetn paid people to move to the Prairies.</li>
            <li>Many people moved west because a transcontinental railway was built.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <h3>Chapter 19: Rural Settlement Patterns</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Rural</b>: Outside towns and cities.</li>
            <li><b>Population distribution</b> refers to characteristics of settlement patterns.
            <ul>
            <li><b>Dispersed</b> patterns are typical of areas with an agricultural base because people tend to live on farms that are spread out over the region.</li>
            <li><b>Concentrated</b> patterns exist when a population gathers around a resource, for example a gold mine will attract miners and their families.</li>
            <li><b>Linear</b> patterns are created when where the economic activities that support people have developed in a line, for example people living along highways in isolated areas.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>More than 90% of Canadians live within 600 kilometres of the border with the United States. The remaining 10% of Canadians are scattered throughout the rest of the country.</li>
            <li>Three key factors affect patterns of rural settlement:
            <ol>
            <li>Resources found in that area.</li>
            <li>Transportation methods available at time of settlement.</li>
            <li>Role played by governing policy.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Long Lots of Southern Quebec</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Settlement took shape in many long and narrow farm lots stretching away from the river.</li>
            <li>When all river lots had been settled in, a second row of long lots was settled along a road parallel to the river.</li>
            <li>Taxes were based on the amount of river frontage.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Concession System of Southern Quebec</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Concession roads and sideroads ran perpendicular to each other, and were approximately two kilometers apart. Farms were unusually 40 to 80 hectares in size.</li>
            <li>Settlement occurred on farms spread out along the concession roads and sideroads.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Section System of Southern Quebec</b>
            <ul>
            <li>The land was divided into blocks, each with an area of around 94 square kilometres. Each block was divided into 36 sections, and each section was then divided into four quarter-sections. Quarter-sections were about 64 hectares in size.</li>
            <li>Pioneer families settled on farms that were spread out along roads bordering sections and quarter-sections.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Comparing the three areas</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>In southern Quebec, farmhouses on long lots are very close to their neighbours. People can rely on others nearby for companionship and help in emergencies. On the other hand, long narrow lots are not very efficient to work with.</li>
            <li>Large consolidated farms on the Prairies are efficient to work with because they are very well-suited to the use of modern farm machinery. However, the people are spread far apart and it takes longer to drive to work, school, etc.</li>
            <li>The farm on concessions in southern Ontario fall midway between those of southern Quebec and the Prairies with regard to efficiency and problems of isolation and long travel distances.</li>
            <li><b>Scattered Settlements</b>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Resource-Based Settlement</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Presence of resource has been the cause of isolated rural settlement: The Atlantic Maritime, Boreal Shield, Boreal Plains, Montane Cordillera, and Pacific Maritime ecozones.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Section System of Southern Quebec</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Scattered among major roads and highways to provide service to residents and travellers passing through, like gas stations, souvenir shops, motels, and small restaurants that cater to travellers on busy highways.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
