      <h3>Key Terms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Geography</b>: The study of Earth's physical and human systems and the relationships among them.</li>
        <li><b>Population Density</b>: Figure calculated by dividing the population of a region by the region's area.</li>
        <li><b>Map</b>: Representation of Earth's features drawn on a flat surface.</li>
        <li><b>Scale</b>: Measurement on a map that represents an actual distance on Earth's surface.</li>
        <div class="key" id="long-lat">
          <li><b>Latitude</b>: Distance north or south of the equator, measured in degrees.</li>
          <li><b>Longitude</b>: Distance east and west of the prime meridian, measured in degrees.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="key" id="cont-plate">
          <li><b>Continental Drift</b>: Theory by German scientist Alfred Wegener stating that 300 million years ago all of Earth's land masses, which were in constant motion, collided to form one supercontinent Pangaea. About 200 million years ago Pangaea broke apart and the continents have drifted apart to their present locations. According to his theory, only continents drifted.</li>
          <li><b>Plate Tectonics</b>: The theory states that Earth's outer shell is made up of about 20 plates. It is likely that <b>convection currents</b> caused by the unequal distribution of heat within the Earth's core cause the plates to move.</li>
        </div>
        <li><b>Pangaea</b>: Supercontinent that included all Earth's land masses. It existed from <span class="red">300 million years ago</span> and began breaking up <span class="red">200 million years ago</span>.</li>
        <li><b>Convection Currents</b>: Circular movement in a gas or liquid created by uneven heating.</li>
        <li><b>Erosion</b>: Wearing away of Earth's surface followed by the movement to other locations of materials that have worn away.</li>
        <li><b>Geologic Time</b>: History of Earth from its formation to the present. Earth's history may be divided into several major time periods, called eras:
          <ul>
            <li>Cenozoic era (<span class="red">66 million years ago to present</span>)</li>
            <li>Mesozoic era (<span class="red">245 million to 66 million years ago</span>)</li>
            <li>Paleozoic era (<span class="red">570 million to 245 million years ago</span>)</li>
            <li>Precambrian era (<span class="red">4.6 billion to 570 million years ago</span>)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Soil</b>: Surface layer of Earth, composed of mineral and organic materials, air, and water.</li>
        <li><b>Humus</b>: Dark, upper layer of soil made up of partially decayed plant material.</li>
        <li><b>Soil Profile</b>: Different horizons (layers) in the soil and the rock layer (bedrock) below the soil. Each horizon has different physical, biological, and chemical characteristics.</li>
        <div class="key" id="leach-calc">
          <li><b>Leaching</b>: Removal of minerals from soil by water as it moves downward through the soil. Leaching occurs in wet climates. Leached soils can be much more productive in farming if natural or chemical fertilizers are used to replace leached nutrients.</li>
          <li><b>Calcification</b>: Process by which, in dry climates, water carrying dissolved minerals moves upward through the soil. At the surface, the water evaporates, leaving the minerals behind. The result is the creation of a thick topsoil layer that is rich in minerals. In very dry climates, however, the amount of mineral deposition can be so great that it forms a layer poisonous to plants.</li>
        </div>
        <li><b>Capillary Action</b>: Movement of water upward through small spaces, as in soil.</li>
        <li><b>Ecozone</b>: A distinct ecological region determined on the basis of physical, biological, and human factors.</li>
        <div class="key" id="im-em-demo">
          <li><b>Immigrate</b>: To move permanently to a country other than one's native country.</li>
          <li><b>Emigrate</b>: To leave your country of origin to live permanently in another country.</li>
          <li><b>Demography</b>: Study of population numbers, distribution, trends, and issues.</li>
        </div>

          <li><b>Assimilate</b>: To lose your culture and adopt the culture of the larger group within which you live.</li>
        </div>
        <li class="key" id="treaty"><b>Treaty</b>: Written agreement between parties in dispute.</li>
        <li class="key" id="first"><b>First Nations</b>: An Aboriginal group whose members wish to be treated as a distinct group on the basis of a shared common culture and history.</li>

        <li><b>Settlement Pattern</b>: Distribution of homes, farms, villages, towns, and cities in an area.</li>
        <li><b>Population Distribution</b>: Pattern showing where people live in an area. For example, a scattered distribution along a coastline or road.</li>
        <li><b>Basic Industry</b>: Industry that sells its products outside the community, bringing money into the community.</li>
        <li><b>Non-Basic Industry</b>: Industry that sells its products within the community. It does not bring money into the community.</li>
        <li><b>Land Use</b>: How urban, suburban, or rural land is and can be used (eg. parks, housing, industry, commercial, agriculture, etc.).</li>

      <h3>Chapter 1: An Overview</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Canada's Population: 36,250,000 (2016)</li>
        <li>World's Population: 7,400,000,000 (2016)</li>
        <li>Canada's Population Density: 3/km<sup>2</sup></li>
        <li>GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita is the value of all goods and services produced in the country in a year. GDP divided by the country's population, the result is an indication of the average wealth per person.
          <ul>
            <li>Canada's GDP per capita: $38293.28 USD (2014)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Canada: high immigration rate, high life expectancy, great amount of freshwater, low number of prisoners, highly educated, environmentally sustainnable method, high <b>HDI (Human Development Index)</b> → combines measures in three critical areas: health, education, and wealth.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Chapter 2: Maps: The Geographer's Basic Tools</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A <b>map</b> is a representation of Earth's features drawn on a flat surface.</li>
        <li>Six basic map features:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Title</b></li>
            <li><b>Legend</b></li>
            <li><b>Scale</b></li>
            <li><b>Date of Publication</b></li>
            <li><b>Direction</b></li>
            <li><b>Border</b></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <b>scale</b> of a map shows the relationship between the size of an object in real life and its size as drawn on the map.
          <ol>
            <li>Fraction or ratio (eg. 1:50,000) </li>
            <li>Direct statement scale (eg. 1cm to 0.5km)</li>
            <li>Line scale (graphic)</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Small-Scale Maps</b> show a small amount of detail in a large area. They are used to show more general information such as physical, political, or economic information. (1 : 200 000 or less)</li>
        <li><b>Large-Scale Maps</b> show a large amount of detail in a small area. They are used for more detailed tasks, such as residential planning, military operations, and for hiking trails. (1 : 100 000 or more)</li>
        <li>Three main types of maps:
          <ul>
            <li><b>General-Purpose Maps</b> contain many different types of information, relatively accurate (atlas maps, wall maps, road maps, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Thematic Maps</b> are designed to show information on one particular topic or theme, tend to be easy to understand (TTC maps, mineral distribution map, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Topographic Maps</b> use symbols to show a variety of features. Two important features are <b>contour lines</b> and <b>grid systems</b>. Useful for examining detailed characteristics of a small area.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Map projections:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Equal Area</b>: Correct relative size of countries avoiding major distortion.</li>
            <li><b>Mercator</b>: True compass bearings, but distorts distance and size of land.</li>
            <li><b>Winkel Tripel</b>: Balanced between size and shape.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Geotechnology: <b>GPS (Global Positioning System)</b></li>
        <li><b>Waypoint</b>: A stored location in a GPS unit.</li>
        <li><b>Telematic Device</b>: Combines GPS capabilities with the ability to transmit vehicle locations to a remote receiver.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Chapter 3: Locating Places on a Map</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Longitude</b> and <b>Latitude</b> (<a href="#long-lat">See in key terms</a>)</li>
        <li><b>Compass Points</b> are such as north, southeast. The <b>cardinal points</b> of a compass are north, south, east, and west. The <b>ordinal points</b> are northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.</li>
        <li><b>Compass Bearings</b> are measured in degrees and are more accurate.</li>
        <li>Grid Rerence Systems:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Alphanumeric Grid</b>: Grid rows and columns labeled by letters and numbers.</li>
            <li><b>Latitude and Longitude</b>: N and S longitude lines that intersect with E and W latitude lines divide the earth into a series of grid squares (usually black lines).</li>

      <h3>Chapter 11: Canada's Geologic History</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Plate Tectonics</b> and <b>Continental Drift</b> (<a href="#cont-plate">See in key terms</a>):
          <ol>
            <li>Jigsaw fit between South America and Africa.</li>
            <li>Fossils of plants and animals on both continents.</li>
            <li>Mountains similar in age and structure on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean&mdash;the Appalachians in eastern United States and Canada and the Caledonian Mountains in northern British Isles and Europe.</li>
            <li>Ice sheets covered parts of Africa, India, Australia, and South America about 250 million years ago&mdash;they were closer to the South Pole before.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Making Mountains</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>Collisions of Earth's plates form mountains.</li>
            <li>They ride atop a subsurface area of molten rock whose extremes of temperatures and pressure cause convection currents.</li>
            <li>The currents move the mantle which moves the plates.</li>
            <li>When an oceanic plate meets a continental plate, the oceanic plate slides under the continental plate and causes the plate to buckle, forming mountains. Regions around the Pacific Ocean were created through this process.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Folding and Faulting</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>When pressure is being exerted towards each other, folding occurs, creating mountains.</li>
            <li>When pressure is being exerted away from each other, faulting occurs. Escarpments are caused by single faulting, rift valleys are formed by double faulting.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Land is built up through:
          <ul>
            <li>Volcanoes</li>
            <li>Moving Plates</li>
            <li><b>Deposition</b>: by movement of wind and water</li>
            <li>Magma and Lava</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Land is worn away (erodes) through:
          <ul>
            <li>Rain, Rivers, Oceans</li>
            <li>Wind</li>
            <li>Glaciers</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Erosion and Mountain Building change the physical landscape.</li>
        <li>Earth's geological history divided into:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Precambrian Era</b>:
              <ul>
                <li>Earliest Era (<span class="red">4.6 billion to 570 million years ago</span>)</li>
                <li>Many cycles of building and wearing down (erosion).</li>
                <li>Single/multi-celled organisms started to appear.</li>
                <li>The foundation of Canada (Canadian Shield) was formed during this era.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Paleozoic Era</b>:
              <ul>
                <li>Refers to "ancient life" (<span class="red">570 to 245 million years ago</span>)</li>
                <li>More mountain building, lots of erosion.</li>
                <li>Erosion produced sediments which are small particles of rock which have been worn down.</li>
                <li>Layers of sediments were compressed together to form sedimentary rocks, becoming the bedrock in every province.</li>
                <li>Appalachians in Eastern Canada are formed.</li>
                <li>Age of amphibians and fish.</li>
              </ul>

            <li><b>Mesozoic Era</b>:
              <ul>
                <li>Refers to "middle life" (<span class="red">245 to 66 million years ago</span>)</li>
                <li>Formation of Rocky Mountains begins.</li>
                <li>Innuitian Mountains formed when Eastern Arctic "folded".</li>
                <li>Age of reptiles.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Refers to "recent life" (<span class="red">66 million years ago to present</span>)</li>
                <li>Glaciers were the most significant force in shaping the land during this era and especially Canada.
                  <ul>
                    <li>They eroded and rounded the Canadian Shield and the Appalachians.</li>
                    <li>Once melted, they deposited the eroded material to create the lowlands surrounding the Canadian Shield.</li>

        <h4>Ice and Glaciers</h4>
        <li>Ice is one of the hardest substances on earth.</li>
        <li><b>Glacier</b>: Slow moving mass of ice.</li>
        <li><b>Ice Sheet</b>: Large, thick mass of ice.</li>
        <li>Ice sheets have covered vast areas of many continents in the past, including much of North America.</li>
        <li><b>Ice Age</b> (<span class="red">6000 to 10000 years ago</span>)
          <ul>
            <li>Period of time when freezing temperatures created ice sheets across continents.</li>
            <li>Temperatures were low enough to allow ice to accumulate in great amounts. Glaciers advanced (grew in size).</li>
            <li>When temperatures were warmer, glaciers retreated (shrank in size).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <b>movement of glaciers</b> depend on climate and location</li>
        <li>2 kinds of glaciers:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Alpine Glaciers</b>:
              <ul>
                <li>Move from high to low elevation due to gravity.</li>
                <li>Carve the land, creating U-shaped valleys.</li>
                <li>Exist in Western Cordillera and Arctic Islands (eg. Columbia Icefields: largest area of ice in Canada).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Continental Glaciers</b>:
              <ul>
                <li>Move under their own weight.</li>
                <li>Weight of snow and ice itself cause ice to spread outward from <b>zone of accumulation</b> (usually located in the centre of the sheet).</li>
                <li>Areas where there is a net loss of ice is known as the <b>zone of ablation</b>.</li>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Glaciers move faster at the surface due to less friction.</li>
        <li><b>Transformation of Land</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>When glaciers move, they transform the land by eroding, shifting, carving, moving debris, etc.</li>
            <li>Erode high points on the land (erosional transformation).</li>
            <li>Fill in lower areas with deposits (depositional transformation).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Erosional Features</b>:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Striations</b>: Grooves gouged out in the bedrock under the ice sheet by rocks frozen in ice.</li>
            <li><b>Spillway</b>: Deep valley created by large amounts of water flowing from a melting continental glacier, if there is less water it is a misfit stream (small stream).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Depositional Features</b>:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Till</b>: Eroded material deposited directly by the ice of the glacier (mix of all material of all sizes).</li>
            <li><b>Till Plain</b>: Flat to gently hilly area created by deposition under a glacier.</li>
            <li><b>Lake Plain</b>: Fertile bottom of an ancient glacial lake now used for agriculture.</li>
            <li><b>Moraine</b>: Material deposited by a glacier that moves parallel with the glacier.</li>
            <li><b>Drumlin</b>: Egg-shaped hill with a steep side at the wide end and a gentle slope at the other. The glacier moved from the steeper to gentler slope.</li>
            <li><b>Erratics</b>: Rock picked up by ice, carried along and deposited many kilometres away. They are easily identifiable: composition is different from the bedrock of region in which it's deposited.</li>
            <li><b>Esker</b>: Long ridge of material deposited by a meltwater stream flowing beneath the glacier.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Benefits of Glaciers</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>Mined as a resource of ice (denser than ice cubes).</li>
            <li>With pollution and industry and acid rain, they are no longer mined.</li>

      <h3>Chapter 13: Canada's Climate Connections</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Climate vs Weather</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Climate: Long term patterns or trends which prevail in a region.</li>
            <li>Weather: Day to day state of the atmosphere (temperature, moisture, precipitation, wind, pressure, etc) in an area.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Climate conditions vary in Canada because:</b>
          <ol>
            <li>Canada is a very large country, it expands far from North to South, East to West.</li>
            <li>The varying elevations cause different climate conditions.</li>
            <li>Canada has both coastal and inland regions</li>
            <li>Wind and pressure systems move weather conditions from one area to another.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Factors That Affect Climate</b>:
          <ol>
            <li><b>L</b>atitude</li>
            <li><b>O</b>cean Currents</li>
            <li><b>W</b>inds and Air Masses</li>
            <li><b>E</b>levation</li>
            <li><b>R</b>eleif (and Other Precipitation)</li>
            <li><b>Near Water</b></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Latitude</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Canada's land extends from <b>41&deg;N</b> to <b>83&deg;N</b>.</li>
            <li>At higher latitudes, the sun's energy is more spread out: cooler temperatures</li>
            <li>Closer to the equator, the sun's energy is more concentrated: warmer temperatures</li>
            <li>Distance from the equator is a key factor in whether a region is hot or cold.</li>
            <li>As the latitude goes up, temperature goes down.</li>
            <li>Earth's curvature causes the sun's energy to be less concentrated at the poles than near the equator.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Ocean Currents</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Temperature of an ocean current affects the temperature of the air that passes over it.</li>
            <li>The air then tranfers these characteristics onto land</li>
            <li><b>5 Ocean Currents That Affect Canada</b>:
              <ul>
                <li><span class="red">North Pacific Current</span></li>
                <li><span class="red">Gulf Stream</span></li>
                <li><span class="blue">California Current</span></li>
                <li><span class="red">North Atlantic Drift</span></li>
                <li><span class="blue">Labrador Current</span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The air above where warm and cool currents meet (eg. Air above the area where the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream meet) is often moist/damp and foggy. The warmer moist air rises, expands, cools on the cooler air, condenses, and precipitates, causing fog.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Winds and Air Masses</b>:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Air Mass</b>:
              <ul>
                <li>Large volume of air.</li>
                <li>Takes on the climate conditions (temperature and precipitation) where it is formed.</li>
                <li>Transfers those conditions to places where it travels.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Wind</b>:
              <ul>
                <li>Wind is created when air masses move.</li>
                <li>Air moves when there is a difference in air pressure.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Air Pressure
              <ul>
                <li><b>Low Pressure</b>:Areas where earth is hot and air above it is warmed, air <b>rises</b> and air pressure will be <b>low</b>.</li>
                <li><b>High Pressure</b>: In the atmosphere, air cools and starts to <b>fall</b>. Air pressure in this area is <b>high.</b></li>
                <li>Air moves from high to low pressure, causing wind.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Precipitation Characteristics</b>:
              <ul>
                <li>Originating over water: Maritime(<b>m</b>) air mass with lots of moisture.</li>
                <li>Originating over land: Continental(<b>c</b>) dry air mass.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Temperature Characteristics</b>:
              <ul>
                <li>Formed near the tropics: Tropical(<b>T</b>) hot air.</li>
                <li>Formed between 55&deg;N and 66&deg;N: Polar(<b>P</b>) cool air.</li>
                <li>Formed over the Arctic: Arctic(<b>A</b>) very cold air.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Air mass over southern continental United States: cT = Continental Tropical = hot dry air.</li>
            <li>Air mass over the Gulf of Mexico: mT = Maritime Tropical = warm moist air.</li>
            <li>Differential heating of the Earth has created high and low pressure wind belts.</li>
            <li>3 main kinds of prevailing winds:
              <ul>
                <li>Polar Easterlies</li>
                <li>Westerlies</li>
                <li>Northeast Trades</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Westerlies</b> move across Canada</li>
            <li>The <b>Polar Front</b> is the boundary between cold, dry polar air and warm, wet tropical air. High above the front is the polar front jet stream (a current of fast moving air). The front is responsible for most of Canada's precipitation</li>
            <li>The winds and jet stream shift according to the seasons.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Elevation</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Atmospheric pressure decreases with higher altitude/elevation. Air at higher altitudes expand due to the lower air pressure.</li>
            <li>When it expands, it cools. Eventually it reaches its dewpoint (the maximum amount of moisture the air mass can hold). Further cooling leads to condensation (water vapour to liquid water).</li>
            <li>Air cools slower above condensation point because the act of condensation produces heat.
              <ul>
                <li><b>Below</b> the condensation point, the rate of change is <b>&minus;1&deg;C/100m</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Above</b> the condensation point, the rate of change is <b>&minus;0.6&deg;C/100m</b>.</li>
                <li>The temperature drops steadily with increase in elevation.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Relief and Other Precipitation</b>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Releif Precipitation</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>When moisture encounters barriers of high releif (eg. mountains), it rises.</li>
                  <li><b>Windward Slope</b>:
                    <ol>
                      <li>As moist air rises, it expands, cools and condenses.</li>
                      <li>As water droplets grow, they form raindrops.</li>
                      <li>When they become too heavy to stay suspended in air, they fall out of the sky as a form of precipitation.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Leeward Slope</b>:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Cold air descends the leeward slope, contracts, and becomes warmer.</li>
                      <li>There is a decrease in condensation and clouds.</li>
                      <li>The leeward slope (rain shadow) has a drier climate than windward slope of barrier.</li>
                      <li>In Canada, Westerlies move warm moist air from the ocean to the coast mountains and the Western Cordillera.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Cyclonic Precipitation</b>:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Also known as <b>frontal precipitation</b>, brings out extended periods of inclement weather.</li>
                      <li>In areas where warm and cold air masses collide, cyclonic precipitation could occur.</li>
                      <li>Lighter, warmer moist air is forced to rise above the colder, denser air.</li>
                      <li>It occurs along the polar front.</li>
                      <li>Counter clockwise cyclonic activity, moves from Western Canada to Eastern Canada.</li>
                    </ul>

      <h3>Chapter 14: Canada's Soil and Natural Vegetation Connections</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Soil</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Consists of four main parts: <b>minerals</b>, <b>bacteria and organic materials</b>, <b>air</b>, and <b>moisture</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Topsoil</b>: Rich in organic materials, especially near the surface. Dark brown or black in colour.</li>
            <li><b>Subsoil</b>: Combined mineral and organic layer. Lighter brown in colour.</li>
            <li><b>Parent Material</b>: Mineral materials from which soil is made. Usually bedrock or glacial deposits.</li>
            <li><b>Loam</b>: A well-balanced mixture of sand, silt, clay, and humus.</li>
            <li><b>Leaching</b> and <b>Calcification</b> (<a href="#leach-calc">See in key terms</a>)</li>
            <li>Because of the Western Cordillera's varied relief and climate patterns, a complex pattern of soils exists, and the characteristics of the soil can change completely over very short distances.</li>
            <li>In contrast, the harsh climate of the tundra soils region makes soil formation difficult. The short, cool growing season limits plant growth and slows the breakdown of organic materials into humus. Because of the permafrost, the soil drains poorly and is often waterlogged. As a result, air may be missing from the soil's profile.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Natural Vegetation Regions</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Natural vegetation refers to those plants that grow without any human interference.</li>
            <li><b>Tundra</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Most northerly vegetation region of Canada.</li>
                <li>Located above the tree line, which marks the northern boundary of most tree growth.</li>
                <li>Most of the tundra has permafrost, or ground that has been frozen for over two years.</li>
                <li>Only permits the growth of small shrubs, mosses, grasses and lichens.</li>
                <li>The lack of vegetation limits the variety of wildlife as well as the population of each species.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Boreal and Taiga Forest</b>
              <ul>
                <li>The largest vegetation region in Canada.</li>
                <li>Coniferous trees&mdash;such as spruce, pines, hemlock, and cedar&mdash;grow in this vegetation region. They have characteristics that make them well-suited to cold temperatures and short growing seasons.</li>
                <li>The lack of humus, combined with the high level of acidity and the leaching effect of water, makes these wet-climate soils infertile and unsuitable for agriculture.</li>
                <li>The northern part of the region is the taiga forest and the southern part is the boreal forest. The taiga forest is less dense than the boreal forest, and has smaller trees that take much longer to grow.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Mixed Forest</b>
              <ul>
                <li>The mixed forest is a transition zone between the boreal and taiga forest to the north and the deciduous forest to the south. Consists of deciduous and coniferous trees&mdash;such as maple, beech, ash, oak, and birch along with spruce, fir, pine, cedar, and hemlock.</li>
                <li>Excellent resource for the lumbering industry.</li>
                <li>Southern region has been cleared because of farming, lumbering, urban development, and transportation routes.</li>
                <li>Soils in the mixed forest regions are well-suited to farming.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Deciduous Forest</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Very small region. Most of this region has been cleared for farming and urban development.</li>
                <li>Conditions are ideal for hardwood trees such as maple, beech, hickory, ash, and black walnut.</li>
                <li>Soils are similar to those of the mixed forest. Most fertile soils of eastern Canada.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Grasslands</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Located in the southern part of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.</li>
                <li>Climate is too dry for most species of trees to survive.</li>
                <li>Drought-resistant short grasses, sagebrush, and cactus grow in the short-grass prairie, in southern Saskatchewan and Alberta.</li>
                <li>The long-grass prairie contains the richest soil in Canada and some of the most productive grain-growing land in the world.</li>
                <li>Parkland is a transition zone of long-grass prairie dotted with clumps of trees.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cordilleran Vegetation</b>
              <ul>
                <li>The variation of vegetation is a result of the wide range of temperatures, rainfall, soils, and elevations throughout the region.</li>
                <li>Account for the large variety of natural vegetation.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>West Coast Forest</b>
              <ul>
                <li>The heavy rainfall plus the mild climate of the coastal region provide excellent growing conditions for the trees of this temperate rain forest.</li>
                <li>Lush forests of Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, red cedar, and western hemlock grow in this region.</li>
                <li>Trees more than a metre in diameter and over 50 metres high are common.</li>

            <li><b>Child Mortality Rate</b>: Yearly number of deaths under eight years old per 1000.</li>
            <li><b>Refugee</b>: A person who immigrates to another country out of fear of persecution in his or her own country.</li>
            <li><b>Immigration Rate</b>: Number of new Canadians who have immigrated here from another country per 1000 of Canada's population.</li>
            <li><b>Emigration Rate</b>: Yearly number of people who move elsewhere.</li>
            <li><b>Net Migration Rate</b>: The difference between people moving to a country and people moving elsewhere from that same country.</li>
            <li><b>Push Factor</b>: Something that makes people want to leave their country and move to another (famine, war, disease, discrimination, unemployment, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Pull Factor</b>: Something that attracts people to another country (education opportunities, employment opportunities, freedom of speech, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Population Growth Rate</b>: Measurement that combines both natural increase and net migration to calculate the overall growth of a country's population.</li>
            <li><b>Life Expectancy</b>: The average lifespan of a person.</li>
            <li><b>Baby Boom</b>: The large rise in the birth rate experienced by many countries in Europe and North America between 1946 and 1961.</li>
            <li><b>Doubling Time</b>: How long it would take for a country's population to double at that country's current rate of population growth.</li>
            <li><b>Rule of 70</b>: The calculation that determines the number of years it will take for a country's population to double. You take 70 and divide it by the <b>population growth rate</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Population Pyramid</b>: Graph that depicts population distribution by age and sex.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Age Roles</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>Children (Under 15)</li>
            <li>Working Adults (15&ndash;64)</li>
            <li>Older Adults (65+)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Dependancy Load</b>: Population that does not work and must be supported (children + older adults)&mdash;Canada has a dependency load of 37% (24% children and 13% older adults), Niger has a 49% dependency load (47% children, and 2% older adults).
          <ul>
            <li>During the 1950s, Canada's population grew because many immigrants came into the country and people had big families (baby boom) after World War II.</li>
            <li>In 1956, there were many kids ages 0&ndash;14, who are now aged 40&ndash;59 (increasing amount of older people).</li>
            <li>In 1956 the focus was on building schools for the large amount of children, whereas now, these children are all grown up and the focus is on health care facilities and retirement centres.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Stages of Population Change</b>
          <ol>
            <li>Combination of high birth rate and high death rate keeps the size of the population stable (no country in the world is at this stage now). Canada went through it in the 17th and 18th centuries.</li>
            <li>Death rate drops because of better healthcare and nutrition, and birth rate remains high which results in a long period of natural increase in the population. Canada's long period of natural increase began more than 150 years ago and continued to the 1960s. This stage began to take place in developing countries only in the last 50 years.</li>
            <li>A drop in the birth rate occurs because parents limit the size of their families since they are certain their children will all survive to adulthood, and most families live in cities and not farms, so they do not need many children to do chores. This stage has only just begun in developing countries.</li>
            <li>The birth rate declines to a point where it is close to the death rate which causes the population to level off. Canada is approaching this point but has not reached it while a few countries in Eastern Europe have reached this point.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Immigration History</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Immigration is important in Canadian history&mdash;it contributed to growth and cultural makeup of the Canadian population.
              <ul>
                <li>400 years of immigration: key factor to population growth.</li>
                <li>Canada is a culturally diverse country.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Since 1876, number of immigrants vary each year (pg 214), periods of boom and bust.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Reasons of Varying Immigration Rates</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>Political (War, Change of Government)</li>
            <li>Economic</li>
            <li>Push/Pull Factors</li>
            <li>Intervening Obstacles</li>
            <li>Natural Factors (Internal/External)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Multiculturalism</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Canada's population is 97% immigrants or descendants of immigrants.</li>
            <li>Immigrants encouraged to retain traditions and language while integrating into Canadian culture.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Where in Canada do Immigrants Settle?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>An uneven distribution of immigrants exists in Canada.</li>
            <li>In 2001, 95% of immigrants lived in Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Alberta.</li>
            <li>Ontario (26.8%) and Alberta (26.1%) have a higher percentage of foreign born residents than the country's overall average (16.4%).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Why Don't Many People Live in Nunavut?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Too Cold</li>
            <li>Remote</li>
            <li>Hard to Build Economic Base</li>
            <li>Infertile Land</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Three Types of Immigrants to Canada</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>Canada government can admit those who qualify for immigration into Canada, but look for those willing and able to contribute to Canada's economy and society.</li>
            <li><b>Three Types</b>:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Economic Immigrants + Family</b>: Skilled workers or business immigrants to create jobs or invest.</li>
                <li><b>Family Immigrants</b>: Reunites families/close relatives&mdash;must have a relative to sponsor and support if needed.</li>
                <li><b>Refugees</b>: Fearing persecution/cruel or inhumane treatment or death due to race, religion, nationality, member of societal group, political opinion, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Interprovincial Migration</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Movement of population between provinces.</li>
            <li>In-Migration: Regions that gain migrants from other provinces.</li>
            <li>Out-Migration: Regions that lose migrants to other provinces.</li>
            <li>The governmetn paid people to move to the Prairies.</li>
            <li>Many people moved west because a transcontinental railway was built.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h3>Chapter 19: Rural Settlement Patterns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Rural</b>: Outside towns and cities.</li>
        <li><b>Population distribution</b> refers to characteristics of settlement patterns.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Dispersed</b> patterns are typical of areas with an agricultural base because people tend to live on farms that are spread out over the region.</li>
            <li><b>Concentrated</b> patterns exist when a population gathers around a resource, for example a gold mine will attract miners and their families.</li>
            <li><b>Linear</b> patterns are created when where the economic activities that support people have developed in a line, for example people living along highways in isolated areas.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>More than 90% of Canadians live within 600 kilometres of the border with the United States. The remaining 10% of Canadians are scattered throughout the rest of the country.</li>
        <li>Three key factors affect patterns of rural settlement:
          <ol>
            <li>Resources found in that area.</li>
            <li>Transportation methods available at time of settlement.</li>
            <li>Role played by governing policy.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Long Lots of Southern Quebec</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Settlement took shape in many long and narrow farm lots stretching away from the river.</li>
            <li>When all river lots had been settled in, a second row of long lots was settled along a road parallel to the river.</li>
            <li>Taxes were based on the amount of river frontage.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Concession System of Southern Quebec</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Concession roads and sideroads ran perpendicular to each other, and were approximately two kilometers apart. Farms were unusually 40 to 80 hectares in size.</li>
            <li>Settlement occurred on farms spread out along the concession roads and sideroads.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Section System of Southern Quebec</b>
          <ul>
            <li>The land was divided into blocks, each with an area of around 94 square kilometers. Each block was divided into 36 sections, and each section was then divided into four quarter-sections. Quarter-sections were about 64 hectares in size.</li>
            <li>Pioneer families settled on farms that were spread out along roads bordering sections and quarter-sections.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Comparing the three areas</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>In southern Quebec, farmhouses on long lots are very close to their neighbours. People can rely on others nearby for companionship and help in emergencies. On the other hand, long narrow lots are not very efficient to work with.</li>
            <li>Large consolidated farms on the Prairies are efficient to work with because they are very well-suited to the use of modern farm machinery. However, the people are spread far apart and it takes longer to drive to work, school, etc.</li>
            <li>The farm on concessions in southern Ontario fall midway between those of southern Quebec and the Prairies with regard to efficiency and problems of isolation and long travel distances.</li>
            <li><b>Scattered Settlements</b>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Resource-Based Settlement</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Presence of resource has been the cause of isolated rural settlement: The Atlantic Maritime, Boreal Shield, Boreal Plains, Montane Cordillera, and Pacific Maritime ecozones.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Section System of Southern Quebec</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Scattered among major roads and highways to provide service to residents and travelers passing through, like gas stations, souvenir shops, motels, and small restaurants that cater to travelers on busy highways.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

      <h3>Chapter 20: Urban Settlement Patterns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Urban</b>: Towns or cities that have more than 1000 people.</li>
        <li><b>Hinterland</b>: The area around a town or city that trades with it. Hinterlands have fewer services and less variety in economic activities than urban areas.</li>
        <li><b>Basic and Non-Basic Industries</b>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Basic Industries</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Industry that sells its products outside the community.</li>
                <li>Brings money into the community.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Non-Basic Industries</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Industry that sells its products within the community.</li>
                <li>Recycles money within the community.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Jobs can be a combination of basic and non-basic.</li>
            <li>Without basic jobs, no new money is coming into the community, so its economic base will be weak, and the community will not be able to sustain itself.</li>
            <li>About three non-basic jobs owe their existence to one basic job. The hiring of 100 workers in a factory really means that a total of about 400 jobs has resulted&mdash;100 basic plus 300 non-basic. This concept is known as the <b>multiplier effect</b>. If 150 workers from a paper mill are laid off, 600 jobs will be lost: 150 basic plus 3&times;150 non-basic.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Christaller's Central Place Theory</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Walter Christaller created a theory as to why large cities or towns are located far apart, while small towns or villages are located relatively close together.</li>
            <li>Christaller's theory is based on the idea that any good or service offered by a <b>central place</b> needs a minimum number of customers in the hinterland to stay in business. The minimum number of customers is known as a <b>threshold population</b>.</li>
            <li>An urban place that provides <b>high-order</b> goods and services requires a large threshold population because they are expensive or are purchased infrequently. A hospital that provides specialized services, such as cancer treatment, is a high-order service that requires a very large threshold population to survive.</li>
            <li>An urban place that provides <b>low-order</b> goods and services requires only a small threshold population to remain in business. A post office survives because it offers a service that is used by a small number of customers, but on a very frequent basis.</li>
            <li>Other stores sell <b>middle-order</b> goods and services, such as clothing and shoes. Because we need these goods and services only from time to time, there are fewer customers shopping for them at any given time. For example, a sporting goods store might have a threshold population of several thousand families.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Different Kinds of Urban Places</b>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Manufacturing Cities</b>: Sarnia, Ontario has a major role as an oil-based manufacturing center.</li>
            <li><b>Transportation Hubs</b>: The CN Rail permitted the shipment of grain and other raw materials from western Canada to Thunder Bay. Those raw materials are then loaded onto ships and are shipped to ports around the world.</li>
            <li><b>Tourist City</b>: Banff is a tourist city&mdash;it supports Canada's local economy as visitors bring “new” money into Banff.</li>
            <li><b>Government Centers</b>: Fredericton provides government services&mdash;religious, cultural, medical, and educational services&mdash;and supplies other services to local citizens and to the rest of the province.</li>
            <li><b>Resource-Based Community</b>: Flin Flon, Manitoba, is a typical resource-based community. Its natural resource is one of the richest copper-zinc deposits in Canada.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Urbanization in Canada</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Today, almost 80% of the population lives in cities and towns. Urbanization is characterized by an increase in population density and by a highly concentrated populated distribution pattern. The growth of services and manufacturing further contribute to urbanization.</li>
            <li>Forestry and mining jobs have disappeared as the use of more efficient tools and machinery became prevalent. Unemployed people moved to cities, in turn, to search for a job.</li>
            <li>At the same time, manufacturing and service industries in urban areas began to develop. This created new jobs that drew people from rural to urban areas.</li>

        <li><b>Residential</b> (40%): Includes all places where people live (houses, apartments, etc.).</li>
        <li><b>Transportation</b> (32%): Used for the transportation of people and goods (highways, roads, parking lots, etc.).</li>
        <li><b>Institutaional and Public Buildings</b> (10%): Contains people interacting to accomplish a general or specific purpose (hospitals, schools, offices, etc.).</li>
        <li><b>Open Space and Recreational</b> (7%): May be previously developed land that are now vacant or land that has been left largely in a natural state (eg. parks, playgrounds, playing fields, golf courses, community centers, and arenas).</li>
        <li><b>Industrial</b> (6%): Factories (processing and manufacturing), warehousing (storage), and shipping products.</li>
        <li><b>Commercial</b> (5%): Places where you buy and sell goods in retail businesses, wholesale, financial establishments, and a wide variety of services broadly classified as business (local service centers, neighborhood plazas, community shopping malls, power centers, regional malls, the Central Business District, etc.).</li>
        <li><b>Residential density</b> refers to the amount of housing units per hectare.</li>
        <li><b>Rural-Urban Fringe</b>: Area adjacent to an urban area where there is a mixture of rural and urban land uses.</li>
        <li><b>Urban Sprawl</b>: Low-density development surrounding a city.</li>
        <li><b>Smart Growth</b>: Conservation policy intended to promote and manage growth of communities, sustain a strong economy in the region and promote a healthy natural environment. An example would be protecting the Oak Ridges Moraine.</li>
        <li><b>New urbanism</b> is a new planning movement to combat urban and suburban sprawl. It includes

      <h3>Chapter 22: Sectors of Canada's Economy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Three primary types of industry: primary, secondary, tertiary.
          <ol>
            <li><b>Primary Industries (Extraction)</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Extract raw materials from natural environment.</li>
                <li>Most resources found in very specific places.</li>
                <li>Canada's main industries are fishing, agriculture, forestry, energy and mining.</li>
                <li>Contribute greatly to Canada's wealth.</li>
                <li>Only small percentage of Canada's workforce is in primary industries.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Secondary Industries (Manufacturing)</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Involved processing primary industrial raw materials into (semi) finished goods.</li>
                <li>Manufacturers make fine products used by consumers and companies.</li>
                <li>Secondary industries employ 4 times as many people as primary industries.</li>
                <li>As raw materials are added, value increases.</li>
                <li><b>Multi-Step Manufacturing</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Manufacturing can involve more than one stage of processing.</li>
                    <li>The first step of this process is called primary manufacturing (things like making steel).</li>
                    <li>When an initial product is used to make another product, the process is called secondary manufacturing, and if that product is used, it is tertiary manufacturing, and so on.</li>
                    <li>Manufacturing industries can be located anywhere in the country, but usually situated near densely populated areas to be close to customers/keep shipping costs low.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Tertiary Industries (Services)</b>
              <ul>
                <li>A range of services that support primary industries, secondary industries, and society in general.</li>
                <li>The majority of Canadians do not produce 'goods' at their jobs but rather provide services for others.</li>
                <li>There are over 3 times as many people working in tertiary industries than in primary and secondary industries combined.</li>
                <li>Service industries are found anywhere and anywhere across the country, but mainly in towns and cities because most services are provided for the people and manufacturers in urban areas.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Quaternary Industries</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Highly specialized (and usually expensive) knowledge-based workers.</li>
                <li><b>Quaternary Worker</b>: Person who works in an industry that involves intellectual services, such as writing software and architectural design. Other quaternary services include the high-tech industry, research and development, and information technology.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

      <h3>Chapter 23: Fishing: An Industry in Crisis</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Has been a popular activity for many centuries as fish in Canada were a renewable resource.</li>
        <li>Europeans came to fish off of Newfoundland since the early 1500's.</li>
        <li>Commercial fishing today makes up only 0.1% of Canada's economy, however it is the foundation of some inland areas, and parts of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.</li>
        <li>Canada is one of the world's leading exporters of fish, some important markets are the US, Western Europe, and countries of the Pacific Rim, especially Japan.</li>
        <li><b>The Freshwater Fishery</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Much less important to the Canadian economy than the east or west coast.</li>
            <li>Inland fisheries located in the Great Lakes, Lake Winnipeg, Great Slave Lake and around 600 other smaller lakes.</li>
            <li>Great Lakes have most important inland fishery.</li>
            <li>In northern Canada, up to 90% of those in commercial fishing are Aboriginal people, as it provides income where jobs are scarce, and make up major and nutritious part of their diet.</li>
            <li>Sport fishing is much more economically important here than commercial fishing, with billions of dollars spent on fishing gear and media.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Production from the east coast is higher than the west coast.</li>
        <li>Different kinds of fish caught by Canadian fishers:
          <ul>
            <li>Groundfish (Bottom-Feeders)</li>
            <li>Pelagic Fish (Open-Water Feeders)</li>
            <li>Shellfish</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li><b>East Coast Fishery</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Atlantic Canada has a wide continental shelf less than 200 meters in depth. On this shelf are even shallower areas called banks that are less than 150 meters deep.</li>
            <li>Sunlight reaches bottom, huge growth in plankton, attracts large numbers of fish.</li>
            <li>The meeting of cool Labrador Current and warm Gulf Stream on the Grand Banks contributes to the rich natural environment. The current churn up nutrients at the bottom that are necessary for plankton growth.</li>
            <li>The largest and best-known fishing region on east coast is the Grand Banks.</li>
            <li><b>Two Distinct Types of Fisheries</b>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Inshore Fishery</b>: Commercial fishing that takes place within a few km of the shoreline. Small fishing boats go out to sea and return to land every day.</li>
                <li><b>Offshore Fishery</b>: Ocean fishery using boats longer than 25 meters. The boats stay at sea several days before returning to shore.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Crisis in the East Coast Fishery</b>
          <ul>
            <li>In the 1980s, people noticed they were catching fewer and smaller fish, particularly northern cod off Newfoundland and southern Labrador.</li>
            <li>An unexpected collapse occurred in 1991, and the Canadian government responded in 1992 by stopping all fishing of northern cod and making major cuts to catches allowed of other groundfish species.</li>
            <li>When the groundfish ban was imposed, scientists, the government, and the fishing industry expected fish populations to recover in 5-7 years. Instead, cod stocks have remained at or below 1992 levels, and may never recover.</li>
            <li>In response, the fishing industry diversified its catch. Fishers now catch larger quantities of other fish such as crab and shrimp, which are shellfish. However, critics say we are overfishing these stocks as well.</li>
            <li><b>Sustained Yield Management</b>: Conservation technique where, when in practice, fish can be harvested forever if the number of fish caught that year doesn't exceed the number of fish reaching maturity in that year.</li>
            <li><b>Five Factors for the East Coast Fishery Collapsing</b>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Overfishing</b>: Federal gov. allowed catch limit to be too high, government scientists may have over-estimated the number of fish that reached adulthood each year. Sustained yield management didn't occur.</li>
                <li><b>Improved Fishing Technology</b>: Ocean fishery using boats longer than 25 meters. The boats stay at sea several days before returning to shore.</li>
                <li><b>Uncontrolled Foreign Fishing</b>: By the late 1960s, fishing fleets of countries such as Russia and Japan caught too many fish to be sustainable. Countries with ocean coastlines urged the UN to extend national fishing limits, which was done in 1977. Canada was extended control of the sea to 370km from the shoreline. Foreign fishing fleets within this limit had to follow Canadian restrictions.</li>
                <li><b>Destructive Fishing Practices</b>: Types of fish caught in nets that were unwanted (such as if a cod fishing boat caught a fish that wasn't a cod) called by-catch were thrown back in the waters, alive or dead. Only wanted fish were reported to officials as being caught, misleading the number of fish actually killed.</li>
                <li><b>Changes in Natural Conditions</b>: Water temperatures have dropped, ocean salinity (saltiness) levels have changed since the mid-1980s, and fish may have altered migration routes. One idea is that the decline in the sealing industry led to a higher population of seals. Seals eat caplin, reducing the number of caplin, which are small fish groundfish feed off of. With less caplin there would be less groundfish, such as cod.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>West Coast Fishery and its Collapse</b>
          <ul>
            <li>The most important catch on the west coast is salmon.</li>
            <li>The failure of the Atlantic fishery caused scientists to re-evaluate the west coast fishery. In 1994, 1 million fewer salmon than predicted came to spawning grounds in British Columbia.</li>
            <li><b>Factors for the East Coast Fishery Collapsing</b>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Changes in Environment</b>: Global warming is raising the temperature of the Pacific Ocean. Salmon prefer water below 7&deg;C, and with the warming Pacific the salmon's range will shift north, eventually spawning in Alaska instead of British Columbia, causing Canada the loss of the salmon fishery.</li>
                <li><b>Lack of a Salmon Fishing Treaty</b>: There is a long-standing dispute between the US (mostly Alaska) and Canada on where salmon may be caught and how much should be caught. Canada officials claim less salmon should be caught to preserve the stock, whereas Alaska says there is enough salmon, and no restrictions are needed. Canada and the US need to agree on how to balance fishing and conservation.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Challenges to the West Coast Fishery</b>
              <ol>
                Supply of salmon is decreasing, yet demand is growing.
                <li><b>First Nations</b>: The Supreme Court decision in 1990 gave First Nations people the right to fish for their own food and for social and ceremonial purpose. This takes precedence over everything (including commercial fishing) except conservation. Also, a focus of many land claims in B.C. by Aboriginals is the right to fish commercially.</li>
                <li><b>Sport Fishing</b>: The sport fishing industry wants a bigger share of available salmon, a salmon caught by a recreational angler yields greater economic benefit than salmon caught by a commercial fishing boat.</li>
                <li><b>Commercial Fishing</b>: Commercial fishers will have to accommodate for growing demand from the First Nations and sport fishers. The federal government is gradually purchasing commercial fishing licenses and fishing boats to reduce the number of commercial fishers.</li>

      <h3>Chapter 24: The Business of Farming</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Agribusiness</b>: farms and sometimes whole operations including growing, storing, processing and distributing food owned by a large corporation, family or an individual. It is used to refer to agriculture owned by large corporations.</li>
        <li><b>Sustainable Agriculture</b>: Approach to agriculture production that can be maintained indefinitely without harming the environment.</li>
        <li>Agriculture depends on 4 natural systems:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Climate</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Two variables contribute to farming: heat and moisture.</li>
                <li><b>Growing Tree Days (GDDs)</b> are calculated by the number of degrees the average temperature of a given day exceeds 6&deg;C. Daily GDDs for a whole year are added together to determine the amount of heat available in a location. They also help farmers know if there is enough heat to grow a particular crop.</li>
                <li>Helps farmers know what stage in the plant's growth is best for applying fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides.</li>
                <li><b>Growing Season</b>: The days in which crops can ripen.</li>
                <li><b>Frost-Free Period</b>: The number of days between spring's last frost and autumn's first.</li>
                <li><b>Evapotranspiration</b>: Movement of water into the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and the transpiration from plants. Warm areas have more evapotranspiration than cooler places, therefore requiring more precipitation/irrigation for good plant growth.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Soil</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Composed of minerals, bacteria, and organic minerals, such as humus, air, and moisture.</li>
                <li>Humus is decaying organic materials such as leaves, grass, twigs, and pinecones.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Biology</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Some organisms are highly beneficial to farming, such as earthworms&mdash;which improve movement of air through soil&mdash;and bees&mdash;who pollinate plants.</li>
                <li>Some organisms are highly destructive to farming, such as weeds or insect pests.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Topography</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Level, well drained land ideal for farming.</li>
                <li>Fertile valleys and deltas are highly productive.</li>
                <li>Mountainous or hilly areas tend to lose topsoil from erosion, and are therefore less productive.</li>
                <li>Flat, sandy areas with high water tables are too wet for farming, making them also less productive.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Correcting Deficiencies</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Canada has few areas with a perfect combo of rich soil, level land, good biological conditions, enough moisture, and a long growing season.</li>
            <li>Developing varieties of crops that mature more quickly or starting seedling growth in a greenhouse for when growing seasons are too short or too cool.</li>
            <li>Irrigation or growing methods that preserve moisture, or the development of crops that require less water for places with insufficient moisture.</li>
            <li>Natural/chemical fertilizers or appropriate plant rotations for infertile soil.</li>
            <li>Building terraces and using cropping practices to minimize erosion for hilly terrain.</li>
            <li>Draining soils or planting crops that can handle or need excess water, such as paddy rice, for low-lying and wet terrain.</li>
            <li>Introducing beneficial insects such as bees where there is a shortage.</li>
            <li>Chemical insecticides, introducing predator insects, cropping methods that limit insects or making GMO insect-resistant crops, to combat an excess of harmful insects.</li>
            <li>Chemical herbicides, manually removing weeds, cropping methods that minimize weeds or making GMO plants that work with herbicides, to combat an excess of weeds.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Crop and animal production contribute to 1.4% of Canada's GDP.</li>
        <li>20% of jobs are related to the agricultural economy sector.</li>
        <li>Canadians spent 25% of income on food in the 1950s, but today they only spend 11%.</li>
        <li>Land is a renewable resource because, if used properly, it can support new crops year after year.</li>
        <li>However the quantity of land is limited&mdash;there is only so much land available. Only 13% of Canada's land is suitable for agriculture, and said land is threatened by urban growth.</li>
        <li>Classes 1-6 are capable of agriculture, Class 7 land is incapable of farming.</li>
        <li>Increased automation brings increase in farm sizes, but decrease in number of farms and people needed to run them.</li>
        <li><b>Economic Factors of Farming</b>:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Cost or Value of Land</b>: If farmland is expensive, then the farmer will produce high-profit products to pay for land mortgage or higher land taxes that come with land of higher value.</li>
            <li><b>Proximity to Market</b>: Farmers are more likely to produce perishable products like eggs if close to their market, whereas farms further from markets will produce less perishable items, like grain.</li>
            <li><b>Competition</b>: When there's an oversupply of a product, prices drop and farm incomes take a hit. Farms will then grow a different product with higher demand and value.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Intensive Farming</b>: Population density is higher and land is more expensive, and there are small farms that require large investments in labour and machinery for high profits per hectare. Mostly perishable products are produced that must be quickly processed and transported to market.</li>
        <li><b>Extensive Farming</b>: Population density is low and land is plentiful and inexpensive, there large farms that turn a profit even with low yield per hectare. They are highly automated with few workers&mdash;common in the prairies, interior southern BC, parts of Ontario and Quebec further from major cities. This type of farming includes cattle ranching, grains and oilseeds. Products are further from market and so are usually less perishable.</li>
        <li><b>Issues Canadian Farmers face Today</b>:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Loss of Farmland</b>: The best farmland is located near our largest cities, but land is being overtaken by urban growth.</li>
            <li><b>Agribusiness &gt; Family Farms</b>: Family farms are declining in number as they are being bought up by large corporations, turning farming from a family businesses to an agribusiness.</li>
            <li><b>Practices of Damaging Soil</b>: Lack of <b>sustainable agriculture</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Organic Farming</b>: The production of crops and animals without chemical fertilizers, pesticides, radiation or GMOs.</li>
            <li><b>BSE (Mad Cow Disease)</b>: halted the trade of Canadian beef to 34 countries, including the US after a single case was found in Alberta.</li>
            <li><b>Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)</b>: When scientists transfer a gene from one organism to another to introduce a desirable characteristic.</li>

      <h3>Chapter 25: Forest Resources and Their Uses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Key Terms</b>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Sustained Yield Forest Management</b>: Use of forest resources at a rate that allows the forests to renew themselves.</li>
            <li><b>Softwood</b>: Wood from coniferous trees (needle-leaved).</li>
            <li><b>Hardwood</b>: Wood from broad-leaved trees such as maple, oak, and elm. Hardwood is used to make furniture, sports equipment, tool handles, floors, and boats. Not all hardwoods are “hard”, for example, poplar and basswood are actually quite soft.</li>
            <li><b>Commercial Forest</b>: Part of a forest that has large enough trees and is close enough to a market to allow it to be harvested by the forest industry.</li>
            <li><b>Non-Commercial Forest</b>: Part of a forest that has trees too small to harvest or is too far away from the market.</li>
            <li><b>Clear-Cutting</b>: Logging method whereby all trees in an area are cut at one time.</li>
            <li><b>Shelterwood Logging</b>: Method of logging, often used in forests with trees of uniform age and size, that clear-cuts parts of the forest, leaving some seed-bearing trees to regenerate the logged area.</li>
            <li><b>Selective Cutting</b>: Lumbering technique in which only trees of a certain type, size, and quality are cut.</li>
            <li><b>Acid PRecipitation</b>: Rain, snow, or fog created after sulphur dioxide and nitric oxides mix with water vapour in the atmosphere. Acid precipitation kills vegetation and turns lakes acidic, causing fish to die and wildlife to disappear.</li>
            <li><b>Stewardship</b>: The management of resources in a careful and sustainable way.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Forest Facts</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Forests cover 42% of Canada.</li>
            <li>Softwood forests make up 66% of Canada's forests.</li>
            <li>Mixedwood makes up 22% of Canada's forests.</li>
            <li>Hardwood makes up the remaining 12%.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Characteristics of Forests</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Commercial forests exist in the warmer, wetter areas of Canada where they can be harvested quickly.</li>
            <li>They are easily accessible by road, railway, or waterway.</li>
            <li>Non-commercial forests exist to the north where precipitation levels and temperatures are too low.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Forest Regions</b>
          <ul>

                <li>By far the largest forest region.</li>
                <li>The region is mainly made up of coniferous trees, but there are some deciduous trees.</li>
                <li>There is slow growth due to long winters and low precipitation.</li>
                <li>Small trees are the most common, therefore pulp and paper production is more important that lumber production.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Taiga Forest</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Includes the Taiga Shield, Taiga Plains, and Taiga Cordillera.</li>
                <li>There are stunted trees due to thin soils, cool temperatures, short growing season, and areas of permafrost.</li>
                <li>The region is mainly made up of coniferous trees, but there are some deciduous trees.</li>
                <li>Most of it is inaccessible, so only small parts are logged, mainly for pulp and paper.</li>
              </ul>

                <li>There are temperate coniferous rainforest on the western slope of the coastal mountains.</li>
                <li>The abundant relief precipitation, moderate temperatures, and long growing season make large trees</li>
                <li>The large trees are used for lumber, cedar shingles, and plywood.</li>

      <h3>Chapter 26: Canada's Mineral Wealth</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Minerals are pure, abiotic substances found in rock.</li>
        <li>Three main groups:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Metallic Minerals</b>: Minerals that metals are extracted from like gold, silver, or platinum.</li>
            <li><b>Fossil Fuels</b>: Minerals that fuel can be extracted from, like coal, natural gas, oil and oil sands.</li>
            <li><b>Industrial Minerals</b>: Minerals that are not metallic or fossil fuels, like clay products, diamond, gravel, potash, salt, and sand.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Canada is third in the world for mineral production.</li>
        <li>Canada leads the world for mineral exports.</li>
        <li>The mining industry has also contributed greatly to the development of Canada's transportation system.</li>
        <li><b>Mineral Reserves</b>: Known quantity of minerals in a country or area.</li>
        <li>Canada's mining reserves decrease each day they are mined. Since it is critical to our economic future, Canada needs to continuously explore new mineral reserves. Finding new reserves is increasingly difficult, as mineral deposits are only found in certain parts of the world and most deposits have already been discovered. In addition, mineral exploration costs are very high.</li>
        <li>To keep costs low, geologists must narrow the search for minerals to areas where they think they have the best chance of finding them.</li>
        <li>Metallic minerals are found in igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Canadian Shield.</li>
        <li>Mining companies make risky decisions&mdash;companies either go out of business or produce a huge profit for workers.</li>
        <li><b>Ore</b>: Rock that contains enough valuable minerals to make mining profitable.</li>
        <li>As many mining sites are located in very remote areas, the difficulty and costs of developing these mines are greatly increased.</li>
        <li>There are three mining methods:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Strip Mining</b>: Method of mining used to recover mineral deposits located very near the surface.</li>
            <li><b>Open Pit Mining</b>: Method of mining using a large hole that is dug for the purpose of extracting ore found near Earth's surface.</li>
            <li><b>Underground Mining</b>: Method of mining used to recover deep mineral deposits.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Milling</b>: Processing ore into concentrates. Milling separates some of the waste rock from the ore by crushing, separating, filtering, and drying raw ore.</li>
        <li><b>Smelting</b>: Process whereby metals are removed from ore or concentrate for use in industry.</li>
        <li><b>Slag</b>: Impurities that are separated from molten metal and removed during smelting. When slag is cooled, it has many uses such as fertilizer, as ballast for railway trucks, and in cement.</li>
        <li><b>Taillings</b>:Waste materials left over from processing ore. It is often treated with chemicals and fertilizers to encourage the growth of trees and grasses.</li>
        <li>Canada's mining industry produces pollutants that cause acid precipitation. Abandoned mines are still a source of pollution. Canada's mining industry can be affected by other country's economy, especially by our key customers. Many high-quality reserves are being depleted. Many new mineral deposits are constantly being discovered in developing countries. Because of their cheaper labour costs, they are able to sell their mineral products more cheaply than Canadian companies. Canada thus has more foreign competition. Mining towns are completely dependent upon their mines. When a mine closes, a town may not survive.</li>

      <h3>Chapter 27: Energy Powering Our Nation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Most energy is used in transportation and industry.</li>
        <li>Energy is generated from <b>conventional</b> (hydro, nuclear, fossil fuels) and <b>alternative</b>(solar, wind, biomass) sources.</li>
        <li>Fossil fuels and electricity make up 98% of Canada's energy uses (energy is relatively cheap in Canada).</li>
        <li>Most of Canada's coal is found in the Prairies (formed 300,000,000 years ago).</li>
        <li>The industry contributes $4,500,000 million to the GDP and accounts for 55,000 jobs.</li>
        <li>3 types of coal in order of quality (Anthracite, Bituminous, Lignite).</li>
        <li>Oil and gas were formed from compacted remains of sea animals hundreds of million years ago.</li>
        <li>Found within layers of porous rocks and recovered using <b>flowing</b> or <b>non-flowing</b> wells.</li>
        <li><b>Flowing Well</b>: Used when there is enough pressure on the deposit to force the resource to the surface, controlled by a “Christmas Tree” (special series of valves).</li>
        <li><b>Non-Flowing Well</b>: Used when there isn't enough pressure, and when the oil must be pumped out of the ground.</li>
        <li>Most oil and gas is found in Alberta.</li>
        <li>It is hard to identify the structures in which oil and gas are found because there is no guarantee that it will contain fossil fuels.</li>
        <li>Geologists conduct seismic surveys, look for rocks with traces of oil on the top, and look for evidence of fossil fuels.</li>
        <li>Issues with Oil Deposits: The more oil extracted from a deposit, the harder it is to extract, and after the oil has been extracted, there is another entire process to go through for retrieving maximum amount (called <b>Secondary Extraction</b>).</li>
        <li>Even after secondary extraction, the maximum amount of oil companies have been able to extract is 60% of the oil reserve (even a 5% increase in the amount extracted, could be worth more than finding another deposit).</li>
        <li>Electricity is produced by <b>generators</b> (all generators work by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy).</li>
        <li>Large-scale generators use turbines to generate electricity (hydro-electric, thermal-electric, and nuclear-electric).</li>
        <li>A complex power grid is used to supply energy all over Canada (it is also moved back and forth with the US).</li>
        <li><b>Hydroelectricity</b> generators are built on large rivers (use the force of water moving from higher to lower elevation). They are not expensive to operate, but they are expensive to build and transport, and it is very eco-friendly (no fossil fuels!), but it may damage habitats.</li>
        <li><b>Thermal electricity</b> generates power by burning fuel to evaporate water. The generators can be built anywhere and are cheaper to build than hydro-electric generators, but they are not eco-friendly (fossil fuels).</li>
        <li><b>Nuclear Electricity</b> uses fission to heat water, and has a low cost of operation and energy transportation. Nuclear electricity generators do not use greenhouse gases but nuclear waste is dangerous, Canada has a lot of uranium.</li>
        <li>Energy accounts for 6% of Canada's GDP (2003), employs 230 000 people, and takes up 16% of Canada's investment. It has also been an important part of foreign trade since 1969 as 90% of energy exports go to the US.</li>

      <h3>Chapter 28: Location Factors and Manufacturing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Proximity of Raw Materials</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Companies that deal with perishable foods, such as fruits and vegetables that must be processed quickly after being harvested, locate in areas where those crops are grown. And example would be McCain Foods, who are located in major potato growing areas.</li>
            <li>Factories that use bulky, heavy raw materials to make finished products that are relatively smaller and lighter also locate near the source of their raw materials.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Locations of Markets</b>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Market</b>: Customers of a company.</li>
            <li>Locating close to the market keeps delivery costs low, and delivery times short, giving a company an advantage over competitors that are not located near their markets. Proximity is an important consideration in the oil industry, especially in an emergency when customers need a critical part right away.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Availability of Fresh Water and Power</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Steel makers, oil refineries, and many other manufacturers use vast amounts of fresh water for cooling and cleaning purposes.</li>
            <li>Another basic need of manufacturing is a supply of inexpensive power. The availability of cheap hydroelectricity can play an important role in determining the location of factories. An example is Alcan Inc., which has has built smelters in the Saguenay River Valley in Quebec because the Saguenay and its tributaries are tremendous sources of hydroelectric power.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Labour Supply</b>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Labour Supply</b>: Availability of workers or labour force (total number of people working and looking for work in an area).</li>
            <li>Canadian companies need workers with high-level technological skills. Such manufacturers tend to locate in parts of the country that have universities, colleges and apprentice programs that produce the skilled workers they need. An example is RIM, which is located near the University of Waterloo.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Transportation</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Most manufacturers need access to fast and efficient transportation.</li>
            <li>Some companies are located to receive easy access to ships, international airports or seaports, while others need access to railroads or national and international highways.</li>
            <li>Dow Chemical Canada Inc. is located in Sarnia because of the fast and efficient transportation of its raw material through this pipeline.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Political Factors</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Federal, provincial, and municipal governments often make political decisions that improve the business climate and attract new companies.</li>
            <li>Highway 407 was built as an alternative route to the congested Highway 401. Many manufacturers are drawn as they can transport their raw materials and finished products efficiently and auto-parts companies are attracted as they are confident that their deliveries can be made when required.</li>
            <li>Toyota Canada Inc. was offered subsidies and incentives to locate in Canadian cities such as Cambridge and Woodstock, Ontario. Because of this, the employment rate has risen and this builds on Canada's economy.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Availability of Fresh Water and Power</b>
          <ul>
            <li>In manufacturing, particular influences on the location of factories that are more general and difficult to measure.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Canada’s Auto Industry has become a successful industry because all seven location factors had contributed.</li>
