            <h3>Key Terms</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Geography</b>: The study of Earth’s physical and human systems and the relationships among them.</li>
            <li><b>Population Density</b>: Figure calculated by dividing the population of a region by the region’s area.</li>
            <li><b>Map</b>: Representation of Earth’s features drawn on a flat surface.</li>
            <li><b>Scale</b>: Measurement on a map that represents an actual distance on Earth’s surface.</li>
            <div class="key" id="long-lat">
            <li><b>Latitude</b>: Distance north or south of the equator, measured in degrees.</li>
            <li><b>Longitude</b>: Distance east and west of the prime meridian, measured in degrees.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="key" id="cont-plate">
            <li><b>Continental Drift</b>: Theory by German scientist Alfred Wegener stating that 300 million years ago all of Earth’s land masses, which were in constant motion, collided to form one supercontinent Pangaea. About 200 million years ago Pangaea broke apart and the continents have drifted apart to their present locations. According to his theory, only continents drifted.</li>
            <li><b>Plate Tectonics</b>: The theory states that Earth’s outer shell is made up of about 20 plates. It is likely that <b>convection currents</b> caused by the unequal distribution of heat within the Earth’s core cause the plates to move.</li>
            </div>
            <li><b>Pangaea</b>: Supercontinent that included all Earth’s land masses. It existed from <span class="red">300 million years ago</span> and began breaking up <span class="red">200 million years ago</span>.</li>
            <li><b>Convection Currents</b>: Circular movement in a gas or liquid created by uneven heating.</li>
            <li><b>Erosion</b>: Wearing away of Earth’s surface followed by the movement to other locations of materials that have worn away.</li>
            <li><b>Geologic Time</b>: History of Earth from its formation to the present. Earth’s history may be divided into several major time periods, called eras:
            <ul>
            	<li>Cenozoic era (<span class="red">66 million years ago to present</span>)</li>
				<li>Mesozoic era (<span class="red">245 million to 66 million years ago</span>)</li>
				<li>Paleozoic era (<span class="red">570 million to 245 million years ago</span>)</li>
				<li>Precambrian era (<span class="red">4.6 billion to 570 million years ago</span>)</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
            <li><b>Soil</b>: Surface layer of Earth, composed of mineral and organic materials, air, and water.</li>
            <li><b>Humus</b>: Dark, upper layer of soil made up of partially decayed plant material.</li>
            <li><b>Soil Profile</b>: Different horizons (layers) in the soil and the rock layer (bedrock) below the soil. Each horizon has different physical, biological, and chemical characteristics.</li>
            <li><b>Leaching</b>: removal of minerals from soil by water as it moves downward through the soil. Leaching occurs in wet climates. Leached soils can be much more productive in farming if natural or chemical fertilizers are used to replace leached nutrients.</li>
            <li><b>Calcification</b>: : Process by which, in dry climates, water carrying dissolved minerals moves upward through the soil. At the surface, the water evaporates, leaving the minerals behind. The result is the creation of a thick topsoil layer that is rich in minerals. In very dry climates, however, the amount of mineral deposition can be so great that it forms a layer poisonous to plants.</li>
            <li><b>Capillary Action</b>: Movement of water upward through small spaces, as in soil.</li>
            <li><b>Ecozone</b>: A distinct ecological region determined on the basis of physical, biological, and human factors.</li>
            <li><b>Immigrate</b>: To move permanently to a country other than one’s native country.</li>
            <li><b>Emigrate</b>: To leave your country of origin to live permanently in another country.</li>
            <li><b>Demography</b>: Study of population numbers, distribution, trends, and issues.</li>
            <li><b>Dependancy Load</b>: Proportion of the population that is not in the workforce; total number of people under 14 and over 65.</li>
            <li><b>Aboriginal Peoples</b>: Descendants of Canada’s first inhabitants.</li>
            <li><b>Treaty</b>: Figure calculated by dividing the population of a region by the region’s area.</li>
            <li><b>Economic Base</b>: Economic activities that allow a community to exist. For example, a town might exist because a mineral resource in the area is being developed.</li>
            <li><b>First Nations</b>: An Aboriginal group whose members wish to be treated as a distinct group on the basis of a shared common culture and history.</li>
            <li><b>Assimilate</b>: To lose your culture and adopt the culture of the larger group within which you live.</li>
            <li><b>Specific Claim</b>: First Nation’s claim based on a belief that the government did not fulfill its obligations under a treaty or other agreement related to land, money, or other assets.</li>
            <li><b>Comprehensive Claim</b>: Claim available to First Nations who have never signed treaties in the past that deals with many issues, including land ownership, self-government, ownership and control of resources, hunting/fishing/trapping rights, and financial compensation.</li>
            <li><b>Settlement Pattern</b>: Distribution of homes, farms, villages, towns, and cities in an area.</li>
            <li><b>Population Distribution</b>: Pattern showing where people live in an area. For example, a scattered distribution along a coastline or road.</li>
            <li><b>Basic Industry</b>: Industry that sells its products outside the community, bringing money into the community.</li>
            <li><b>Non-Basic Industry</b>: Industry that sells its products within the community. It does not bring money into the community.</li>
            <li><b>Land Use</b>: How urban, suburban, or rural land is and can be used (eg. parks, housing, industry, commercial, agriculture, etc.).</li>

            <h3>Chapter 1: An Overview</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Canada's Population: 36,250,000 (2016)</li>
            <li>World's Population: 7,400,000,000 (2016)</li>
            <li>Canada's Population Density: 3/km<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li>GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita is the value of all goods and services produced in the country in a year. GDP divided by the country’s population, the result is an indication of the average wealth per person.
            <ul>
            <li>Canada's GDP per capita: $38293.28 USD (2014)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Canada: high immigration rate, high life expectancy, great amount of freshwater, low number of prisoners, highly educated, environmentally sustainnable method, high <b>HDI (Human Development Index)</b> → combines measures in three critical areas: health, education, and wealth.</li>

            <h3>Chapter 2: Maps: The Geographer’s Basic Tools</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>A <b>map</b> is a representation of Earth’s features drawn on a flat surface.</li>
            <li>Six basic map features:

            <li><b>Border</b></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The <b>scale</b> of a map shows the relationship between the size of an object in real life and its size as drawn on the map.
            <ol>
            <li>Fraction or ratio (eg. 1:50,000) </li>
            <li>Direct statement scale (eg. 1cm to 0.5km)</li>
            <li>Line scale (graphic)</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Small-Scale Maps</b> show a small amount of detail in a large area. They are used to show more general information such as physical, political, or economic information. (1 : 200 000 or less)</li>
            <li><b>Large-Scale Maps</b> show a large amount of detail in a small area. They are used for more detailed tasks, such as residential planning, military operations, and for hiking trails. (1 : 100 000 or more)</li>
            <li>Three main types of maps:
            <ul>
            <li><b>General-Purpose Maps</b> contain many different types of information, relatively accurate (eg. atlas maps, wall maps, road maps, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>General-Purpose Maps</b> contain many different types of information, relatively accurate (eg. atlas maps, wall maps, road maps, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Topographic Maps</b> use symbols to show a variety of features. Two important features are <b>contour lines</b> and <b>grid systems</b>. Useful for examining detailed characteristics of a small area.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Map projections:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Equal Area</b>: Correct relative size of countries avoiding major distortion.</li>
            <li><b>Mercator</b>: True compass bearings, but distorts distance and size of land.</li>
            <li><b>Winkel Tripel</b>: Balanced between size and shape.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Geotechnology: <b>GPS (Global Positioning System)</b></li>
            <li><b>Waypoint</b>: A stored location in a GPS unit.</li>
            <li><b>Telematic Device</b>: Combines GPS capabilities with the ability to transmit vehicle locations to a remote receiver.</li>

            <h3>Chapter 3: Locating Places on a Map</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Longitude</b> and <b>Latitude</b> (<a href="#long-lat">See in key terms</a>)</li>
            <li><b>Compass Points</b> are such as north, southeast. The <b>cardinal points</b> of a compass are north, south, east, and west. The <b>ordinal points</b> are northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.</li>
            <li><b>Compass Bearings</b> are measured in degrees and are more accurate.</li>
            <li>Grid Rerence Systems:
            <ol>
            <li><b>Alphanumeric Grid</b>: Grid rows and columns labeled by letters and numbers.</li>

            <li>Ice sheets covered parts of Africa, India, Australia, and South America about 250 million years ago - they were closer to the South Pole before.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Making Mountains</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Collisions of Earth’s plates form mountains.</li>
            <li>They ride atop a subsurface area of molten rock whose extremes of temperatures and pressure cause convection currents.</li>
            <li>The currents move the mantle which moves the plates.</li>
            <li>When an oceanic plate meets a continental plate, the oceanic plate slides under the continental plate and causes the plate to buckle, forming mountains--regions around the Pacific Ocean were created through this process.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Folding and Faulting</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>When pressure is being exerted towards each other, folding occurs, creating mountains.</li>
            <li>When pressure is being exerted away from each other, faulting occurs. Escarpments are caused by single faulting, rift valleys are formed by double faulting.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Land is built up through:
            <ul>
            <li>Volcanoes</li>
            <li>Moving Plates</li>
            <li><b>Deposition</b>: by movement of wind and water</li>

            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Erosion and Mountain Building change the physical landscape.</li>
            <li>Earth's geological history divided into:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Precambrian Era</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Earliest Era (<span class="red">4.6 billion to 570 million years ago</span>)</li>
            <li>Many cycles of building and wearing down (erosion).</li>
            <li>Single/multi-celled organisms started to appear.</li>
            <li>The foundation of Canada (Canadian Shield) was formed during this era.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Paleozoic Era</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Refers to "ancient life" (<span class="red">570 to 245 million years ago</span>)</li>
            <li>More mountain building, lots of erosion.</li>
            <li>Erosion produced sediments which are small particles of rock which have been worn down.</li>
            <li>Layers of sediments were compressed together to form sedimentary rocks, becoming the bedrock in every province.</li>
            <li>Appalachians in Eastern Canada are formed.</li>
            <li>Age of amphibians and fish.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><b>Mesozoic Era</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Refers to "middle life" (<span class="red">245 to 66 million years ago</span>)</li>
            <li>Formation of Rocky Mountains begins.</li>
            <li>Innuitian Mountains formed when Eastern Arctic "folded".</li>

            <li>Refers to "recent life" (<span class="red">66 million years ago to present</span>)</li>
            <li>Glaciers were the most significant force in shaping the land during this era and especially Canada.
            <ul>
            <li>They eroded and rounded the Canadian Shield and the Appalachians.</li>
            <li>Once melted, they deposited the eroded material to create the lowlands surrounding the Canadian Shield.</li>

            <h4>Ice and Glaciers</h4>
            <li>Ice is one of the hardest substances on earth.</li>
            <li><b>Glacier</b>: Slow moving mass of ice.</li>
            <li><b>Ice Sheet</b>: Large, thick mass of ice.</li>
            <li>Ice sheets have covered vast areas of many continents in the past, including much of North America.</li>
            <li><b>Ice Age</b> (<span class="red">6000 to 10000 years ago</span>)
            <ul>
            <li>Period of time when freezing temperatures created ice sheets across continents.</li>
            <li>Temperatures were low enough to allow ice to accumulate in great amounts. Glaciers advanced (grew in size).</li>
            <li>When temperatures were warmer, glaciers retreated (shrank in size).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The <b>movement of glaciers</b> depend on climate and location</li>
            <li>2 kinds of glaciers:
            <ol>
            <li><b>Alpine Glaciers</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Move from high to low elevation due to gravity.</li>
            <li>Carve the land, creating U-shaped valleys.</li>
            <li>Exist in Western Cordillera and Arctic Islands (eg. Columbia Icefields - largest area of ice in Canada).</li>

            <li>Weight of snow and ice itself cause ice to spread outward from <b>zone of accumulation</b> (usually located in the centre of the sheet).</li>
            <li>Areas where there is a net loss of ice is known as the <b>zone of ablation</b>.</li>
            </ul>

            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Glaciers move faster at the surface due to less friction.</li>
            <li><b>Transformation of Land</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>When glaciers move, they transform the land by eroding, shifting, carving, moving debris, etc.</li>
            <li>Erode high points on the land (erosional transformation).</li>
            <li>Fill in lower areas with deposits (depositional transformation).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Erosional Features</b>:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Striations</b>: Grooves gouged out in the bedrock under the ice sheet by rocks frozen in ice.</li>
            <li><b>Spillway</b>: Deep valley created by large amounts of water flowing from a melting continental glacier, if there is less water it is a misfit stream (small stream).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Depositional Features</b>:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Till</b>: Eroded material deposited directly by the ice of the glacier (mix of all material of all sizes).</li>
            <li><b>Till Plain</b>: Flat to gently hilly area created by deposition under a glacier.</li>
            <li><b>Lake Plain</b>: Fertile bottom of an ancient glacial lake now used for agriculture.</li>
            <li><b>Moraine</b>: Material deposited by a glacier that moves parallel with the glacier.</li>
            <li><b>Drumlin</b>: Egg-shaped hill with a steep side at the wide end and a gentle slope at the other. The glacier moved from the steeper to gentler slope.</li>
            <li><b>Erratics</b>: Rock picked up by ice, carried along and deposited many kilometres away. They are easily identifiable: composition is different from the bedrock of region in which it’s deposited.</li>
            <li><b>Esker</b>: Long ridge of material deposited by a meltwater stream flowing beneath the glacier.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Benefits of Glaciers</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Mined as a resource of ice (denser than ice cubes).</li>
            <li>With pollution and industry and acid rain, they are no longer mined.</li>

            <li><b>Climate vs Weather</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Climate: Long term patterns or trends which prevail in a region.</li>
            <li>Weather: Day to day state of the atmosphere (temperature, moisture, precipitation, wind, pressure, etc) in an area.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Climate conditions vary in Canada because:</b>
            <ol>
            <li>Canada is a very large country, it expands far from North to South, East to West.</li>
            <li>The varying elevations cause different climate conditions.</li>
            <li>Canada has both coastal and inland regions</li>
            <li>Wind and pressure systems move weather conditions from one area to another.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Factors That Affect Climate</b>:
            <ol>
            <li><b>L</b>atitude</li>
            <li><b>O</b>cean Currents</li>
            <li><b>W</b>inds and Air Masses</li>
            <li><b>E</b>levation</li>
            <li><b>R</b>eleif (and Other Precipitation)</li>
            <li><b>Near Water</b></li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Latitude</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Canada's land extends from <b>41&deg;N</b> to <b>83&deg;N</b>.</li>
            <li>At higher latitudes, the sun's energy is more spread out - cooler temperatures</li>
            <li>Closer to the equator, the sun's energy is more concentrated - warmer temperatures</li>
            <li>Distance from the equator is a key factor in whether a region is hot or cold.</li>
            <li>As the latitude goes up, temperature goes down.</li>
            <li>Earth’s curvature causes the sun’s energy to be less concentrated at the poles than near the equator.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Ocean Currents</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Temperature of an ocean current affects the temperature of the air that passes over it.</li>
            <li>The air then tranfers these characteristics onto land</li>
            <li><b>5 Ocean Currents That Affect Canada</b>:
            <ul>
            <li><span class="red">North Pacific Current</span></li>
            <li><span class="red">Gulf Stream</span></li>
            <li><span class="blue">California Current</span></li>
            <li><span class="red">North Atlantic Drift</span></li>
            <li><span class="blue">Labrador Current</span></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The air above where warm and cool currents meet (eg. Air above the area where the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream meet) is often moist/damp and foggy. The warmer moist air rises, expands, cools on the cooler air, condenses, and precipitates, causing fog.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Winds and Air Masses</b>:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Air Mass</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Large volume of air.</li>
            <li>Takes on the climate conditions (temperature and precipitation) where it is formed.</li>
            <li>Transfers those conditions to places where it travels.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Wind</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Wind is created when air masses move.</li>
            <li>Air moves when there is a difference in air pressure.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Air Pressure
            <ul>
            <li><b>Low Pressure</b>:Areas where earth is hot and air above it is warmed, air <b>rises</b> and air pressure will be <b>low</b>.</li>
            <li><b>High Pressure</b>: In the atmosphere, air cools and starts to <b>fall</b>. Air pressure in this area is <b>high.</b></li>
            <li>Air moves from high to low pressure, causing wind.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Precipitation Characteristics</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Originating over water: Maritime(<b>m</b>) air mass with lots of moisture.</li>
            <li>Originating over land: Continental(<b>c</b>) dry air mass.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Temperature Characteristics</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Formed near the tropics: Tropical(<b>T</b>) hot air.</li>
            <li>Formed between 55&deg;N and 66&deg;N: Polar(<b>P</b>) cool air.</li>
            <li>Formed over the Arctic: Arctic(<b>A</b>) very cold air.</li>
